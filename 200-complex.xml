plot : two teen couples go to a church party , drink and then drive . 
they get into an accident .
 one of the guys dies ,
but his girlfriend continues to see him in her life , and has nightmares .
 what's the deal ?
 watch the movie and " sorta " find out . . .
 critique : a mind-fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea , 
 but presents it in a very bad package .
 which is what makes this review an even harder one to write ,
 since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold , mess with your head and such ( lost highway &amp; memento ) , 
but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films ,
 and these folks just didn't snag this one correctly .
 they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept , 
but executed it terribly .
 so what are the problems with the movie ?
 well , its main problem is that
 it's simply too jumbled .
 it starts off " normal " but then downshifts into this " fantasy " world in which
 you , as an audience member , have no idea what's going on .
 there are dreams , 
there are characters coming back from the dead ,
 there are others who look like the dead ,
 there are strange apparitions ,
 there are disappearances , 
 there are a looooot of chase scenes ,
 there are tons of weird things that happen ,
 and most of it is simply not explained .
 now i personally don't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then , 
 but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again ,
 i get kind of fed up after a while ,
 which is this film's biggest problem .
it's obviously got this big secret to hide ,
 but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes .
 and do they make things entertaining , thrilling or even engaging , in the meantime ? not really .
 the sad part is that the arrow and i both dig on flicks like this , 
so we actually figured most of it out by the half-way point ,
 so all of the strangeness after that did start to make a little bit of sense ,
 but it still didn't the make the film all that more entertaining .
 i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that
 you should always make sure 
that the audience is " into it " 
even before they are given the secret password to enter your world of understanding .
 i mean , showing melissa sagemiller running away from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movie is just plain lazy ! !
 okay , we get it . . . 
there are people chasing her
 and we don't know who they are . 
do we really need to see it over and over again ?
 how about giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie ? 
apparently , the studio took this film away from its director and chopped it up themselves , and it shows .
 there might've been a pretty decent teen mind-fuck movie in here somewhere , 
but i guess " the suits " decided that turning it into a music video with little edge , would make more sense .
 the actors are pretty good for the most part ,
 although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character that he did in american beauty , only in a new neighborhood .
 but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller ,
 who holds her own throughout the entire film , and actually has you feeling her character's unraveling . 
overall , the film doesn't stick
 because it doesn't entertain , 
 it's confusing ,
 it rarely excites
 and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime , 
despite a pretty cool ending and explanation to all of the craziness that came before it . 
oh , and by the way , this is not a horror or teen slasher flick . . .
 it's just packaged to look that way 
because someone is apparently assuming that
 the genre is still hot with the kids . 
it also wrapped production two years ago and has been sitting on the shelves ever since . 
whatever . . . skip it !

the happy bastard's quick movie review damn that y2k bug .
 it's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother ( william this time ) 
in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on . 
little do they know the power within . . . 
going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there ,
 virus still feels very empty ,
 like a movie going for all flash and no substance .
 we don't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere ,
 we don't know the origin of what took over the ship ( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir )
 , and , of course , we don't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout .
 here , it's just " hey , let's chase these people around with some robots " .
 the acting is below average , even from the likes of curtis .
 you're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20 . 
sutherland is wasted 
 and baldwin , well , he's acting like a baldwin , of course .
 the real star here are stan winston's robot design , some schnazzy cgi , and the occasional good gore shot , like picking into someone's brain .
 so , if robots and body parts really turn you on , here's your movie .
 otherwise , it's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie .

it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch .
 based on the late 1960's television show by the same name ,
 the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover .
 however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen 
 and they are immediately under suspicion . 
of course , the ads make it seem like so much more .
 quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like .
 sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? 
 after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that
 it is not .
 the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , 
complete with nice hair and costumes , 
but that simply isn't enough .
 the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , 
both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . 
and with it comes every single clich ? .
 it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show ,
 as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen .
 the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , 
sometimes even bordering on wooden .
 claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines
 as if they are bored ,
 which really transfers onto the audience .
 the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , 
who plays the resident crazy man ,
 ultimately being the only thing worth watching .
 unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess ,
 as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time .
 with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack ,
 it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset .
 despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) ,
 the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset .
 information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience 
( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) ,
 dialogue is poorly written ,
 and the plot is extremely predictable .
the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy ,
 because you'll know they aren't .
 basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom ,
 especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that
 the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) .
 the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them .
 it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar ,
 judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late .
 avoid this film at all costs .

" quest for camelot " is warner bros . ' first feature-length , fully-animated attempt to steal clout from disney's cartoon empire ,
 but the mouse has no reason to be worried .
 the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall's promising , if flawed , 20th century fox production " anastasia , "
 but disney's " hercules , " with its lively cast and colorful palate , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997's best piece of animation .
 this year , it's no contest ,
 as " quest for camelot " is pretty much dead on arrival .
 even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre -- that'd be " pocahontas " for those of you keeping score -- isn't nearly as dull as this .
 the story revolves around the adventures of free-spirited kayley ( voiced by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur's round table .
 kayley's only dream is to follow in her father's footsteps ,
 and she gets her chance when
 evil warlord ruber ( gary oldman ) , an ex-round table member-gone-bad , steals arthur's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous , booby-trapped forest .
 with the help of hunky , blind timberland-dweller garrett ( carey elwes ) and a two-headed dragon ( eric idle and don rickles ) that's always arguing with itself , 
kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur's side . 
" quest for camelot " is missing pure showmanship ,
 an essential element if it's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney .
 there's nothing here that differentiates " quest " from something you'd see on any given saturday morning cartoon -- subpar animation , instantly forgettable songs , poorly-integrated computerized footage .
 ( compare kayley and garrett's run-in with the angry ogre to herc's battle with the hydra .
 i rest my case . ) 
even the characters stink -- 
none of them are remotely interesting ,
 so much that the film becomes a race to see
 which one can out-bland the others . 
in the end , it's a tie -- they all win .
 that dragon's comedy shtick is awfully cloying , 
but at least it shows signs of a pulse . 
at least fans of the early-'90s tgif television line-up will be thrilled to find jaleel " urkel " white and bronson " balki " pinchot sharing the same footage .
 a few scenes are nicely realized
 ( though i'm at a loss to recall enough to be specific ) ,
 and the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic
 ( though most are paired up with singers who don't sound a thing like them for their big musical moments -- jane seymour and celine dion ? ? ? ) .
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good .
 aside from the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults ,
 " quest for camelot " 's most grievous error is its complete lack of personality .
 and personality , we learn from this mess , goes a very long way .

synopsis : a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy's mother , a fledgling restauranteur .
 unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman's favor ,
 he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way .
 comments : stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies 
which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry , both theatrical and direct-to-video .
 their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that
 they're typically inexpensive to produce ( no special effects , no big name stars ) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity 
( allowing them to frequent late-night cable television ) .
 stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect :
 the psycho never actually has an affair ;
 on the contrary , he's rejected rather quickly
 ( the psycho typically is an ex-lover , ex-wife , or ex-husband ) .
 other than that , stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable .
 stalked does not provide much suspense ,
 though that is what it sets out to do .
 interspersed throughout the opening credits , for instance , a serious-sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk
 ( it's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men )
 while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen .
 after these credits , a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears .
 the narrator states that " this is the story of daryl gleason " and tells the audience that
 he is the stalker .
 of course , really , this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels .
 if the movie was meant to be about daryl ,
 then it should have been called stalker not stalked .
 okay . so we know who the stalker is even before the movie starts ;
 no guesswork required .
stalked proceeds , then , as it begins : obvious , obvious , obvious .
 the opening sequence , contrived quite a bit , brings daryl and brooke ( the victim ) together .
 daryl obsesses over brooke , follows her around , and tries to woo her .
 ultimately rejected by her , his plans become more and more desperate and elaborate .
 these plans include the all-time , psycho-in-love , cliche : the murdered pet .
 for some reason , this genre's films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked .
 stalked is no exception
 ( it's a cat this time -- found in the shower ) .
 events like these lead to the inevitable showdown between stalker and stalked ,
 where only one survives
 ( guess who it invariably always is
 and you'll guess the conclusion to this turkey ) .
 stalked's cast is uniformly adequate :
 not anything to write home about but also not all that bad either .
 jay underwood , as the stalker , turns toward melodrama a bit too much .
 he overdoes it , in other words ,
 but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story demands .
 maryam d'abo , about the only actor close to being a star here ( she played the bond chick in the living daylights ) , is equally adequate as the " stalked " of the title ,
 even though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong , independent business-owner .
 brooke ( d'abo ) needs to be ditzy , however , for the plot to proceed .
 toward the end , for example , brooke has her suspicions about daryl .
 to ensure he won't use it as another excuse to see her ,
 brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house .
 does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers ?
of course not .
 she tries the door , opens it , and wanders around the house .
 when daryl returns , he enters the house , of course ,
 so our heroine is in danger .
 somehow , even though her car is parked at the front of the house , right by the front door ,
 daryl is oblivious to her presence inside .
 the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience's suspension of disbelief and questions the validity of either character's intelligence .
 stalked receives two stars because ,
 even though it is highly derivative and somewhat boring ,
 it is not so bad that
 it cannot be watched .
 rated r mostly for several murder scenes and brief nudity in a strip bar ,
 it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are .
 if you're in the mood for a good suspense film , though ,
 stake out something else .

capsule : in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace .
 there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise . 
john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films , especially assault on precinct 13 ,
that the new film comes off as his homage to himself .
 , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) . 
 john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes .
  for a writer and director of horror films , supposedly an expert on horror , it is a very bad mistake to make .
 ghosts of mars is called a horror movie , 
but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low-powered alien menace . 
in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars ,
 carpenter would have grounds to sue . 
this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13 , the thing , and prince of darkness .
 it is , in fact , surprising that
 carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way .
 but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience .
 ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176 .
 mars has been mostly terraformed 
so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear
 ( which is good for the film's budget ) .
 it is never mentioned , but
 the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth-normal , 
again making it easier to film .
 society has changed a bit by that time , 
but it has advanced surprisingly little .
apparently the culture has changed so that
 women are much more in positions of control .
 and from carpenter's view , women have really made a mess of things .
 society has stagnated under female control so that
 beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten .
 the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in common with that of assault on precinct 13 except that
 precinct 9 ( yes , precinct 9 ) has been replaced by a somewhat tacky looking rundown martian mining colony .
 instead of having the criminal " napolean " wilson ,
 this film has the criminal " desolation " williams .
 instead of facing hoodlums with automatic weapons
 the police face , well , ghosts of mars .
 because the ghosts are somewhat alien in nature they should behave in some alien manner , 
but they essentially behave as human savages ,
 in another lapse of imagination .
 the story is told in flashback , flashback within flashback , and flashback within flashback within flashback .
 ghosts of mars takes place entirely at night 
and is filmed almost entirely in tones of red , yellow , and black . 
carpenter manages to give us a powerful opening scene ,
 showing a mining train rushing through the martian night to the sound of music with a heavy beat . 
sadly what follows is not really up to the buildup .
 the terror he creates looks a little too much like fugitive wannabes from the rock band kiss .
 his idea of building suspense is having a bunch of sudden jump scenes 
that sucker the viewer into thinking something scary is happening 
and then prove to be just something boring .
 these are standard haunted house film shock effects
 that require no great talent to give the audience .
 somewhat newer but also unimpressive are the cgi digital decapitations in some of the fights .
 within a short stretch of time we have seen the release of mission to mars , red planet , and ghosts of mars .
 after mission to mars was panned by too many reviewers
 it looks better and better and better as time goes by .
 i rate ghosts of mars a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale.
 following the movie i showed my wife ,
 who liked ghosts of mars moderately more than i did ,
 carpenter's classic assault on precinct 13 .
 her comment is that it was seeing the same film twice .

so ask yourself what " 8mm " ( " eight millimeter " ) is really all about . 
is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy , sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography ?
 is it about the business itself , how , bubbling just beneath the surface of big-town americana ,
 there's a sordid world of sick and depraved people who won't necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick and twisted desires ? 
or is it about those who can , those who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick and demented people want to see ?
 i'm not talking about snuff films , supposed " documentaries " of victims being brutalized and killed on camera .
 i'm talking about films like " 8mm " and its director , joel schumacher .
 with a recent run of big budget movies to his credit-- " batman &amp; robin , " " a time to kill , " " batman forever , " " the client " --
schumacher certainly has that kind of influence .
 is " 8mm " something you really want to see ? probably not .
 the first two-thirds of " 8mm " unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama , albeit with a particularly unsavory core .
 then , as it's been threatening all along ,
 the film explodes into violence .
 and just when you think it's finally over ,
 schumacher tags on a ridiculous self-righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further .
 trust me .
 there are better ways to waste two hours of your life .
 nicolas ' " snake eyes " ' cage plays private investigator tom welles
 who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether 
a reel of film found in her late husband's safe documents a young girl's murder .
 welles goes about his assignment rather matter-of-factly ,
 and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place rather neatly ,
 almost as if you don't need any specialized skills or training to do this .
 welles certainly makes it look easy .
 and cops , obviously , never look in toilet tanks for clues .
 the deeper welles digs into his investigation 
the more obsessed he becomes ,
 like george c . scott in paul schrader's " hardcore . "
 occasionally , a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector , reminding him of his unpleasant task .
 there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife , played by catherine keener ,
 who is frustrated by her husband spending all of his time in cleveland rather than in their ugly split-level home in harrisburg , pa .
 " 8mm " doesn't condemn or condone its subject matter , 
it just exploits it .
 the irony , of course , is that schumacher and " seven " scribe andrew kevin walker's vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r-rated , first-run hollywood product .
 so we only see snippets of snuff , and a lot more footage of nicolas cage covering his face in horror .
 later it's the turn of joaquin phoenix
 ( who's quite good and by far the film's most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california )
 to cover his face as the horrid thing is screened over and over again .
 all this to get to the familiar yet offensive " revelation " that
 sexual deviants are not , indeed , monsters but everyday people like you and me .
 neither super nor standard , " 8mm " is shocking only in its banality .

that's exactly how long the movie felt to me .
 there weren't even nine laughs in nine months . 
it's a  terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork .
 it's not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me ,
 it's the fact that grant is annoying .
 not just adam sandler-annoying ,
 we're talking jim carrey-annoying .
 since when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? 
but , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick
 ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant's head in joan cusack's lap--
a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres
 ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant's pregnant girlfriend she has " a big pussy , " referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , 
but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie )
 pass for comedy ?
nine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot .
 hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist .
 why a child psychologist ?
 so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : 
kid : my dad's an asshole .
 grant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ?
 kid : my dad's a _huge_ asshole .
 more like a hugh asshole ,
 but that's beside the point , which is :
nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes
 that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience 
while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief .
 so , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) .
 this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , 
especially since grant's equally annoying friend's wife is also pregnant . 
the annoying friend is played by tom arnold ,
 who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick ,
 none of which is funny ,
 such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed " arnie the dinosaur "
 ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store .
 the only  interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum ,
 who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment .
 not even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor .
 his is a one-joke character--
 the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype
 ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? that's my favorite vodka , by the way ) ,
 hence the line " now it's time to take a look at your volvo , " 
another nasty but unamusing joke ,
 except this one goes right over the ten year olds' heads , 
while the adults simultaneously groan .
 nine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy .
 hugh grant's sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters ,
 but they certainly won't leave with a smile on their faces ,
 not after 90 minutes of grant's nervous smiles .
 everything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that
 anyone with an i . q . over 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know 
 they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire .
 but at least they didn't spend 60 bucks for it .

call it a road trip for the walking wounded .
 stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that
 it's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence .
 yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama .
 playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late .
 that's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for ,
 focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . 
they haven't spoken in years , and wouldn't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren't for kaisa's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer .
 in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live .
 ( only in the movies , right ? ) 
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa .
 loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out --
 whenever he isn't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . 
despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn't fallen very far from the tree .
 kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper .
 ain't they a pair ? 
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue ,
 screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward --
 lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative .
 by the time they reach the hospital , it's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past
 that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict ,
 they're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe .
 this revelation exists purely for its own sake .
 aberdeen doesn't know where else to go .
 weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa .
 if lena headey were a stronger actress , 
perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography
 ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) .
headey's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance .
 if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd ,
 maybe she'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . 
it's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter's captivating signs &amp; wonders .
 it's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films
 ( they're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) .
 the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant .
 in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed .
 despite skarsg ? rd's solid performance as tomas ,
 his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . 
there's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs &amp; wonders ,
 allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity .
 nossiter's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain .
 if signs &amp; wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas ,
 at least it's willing to stretch beyond what we've come to expect from traditional drama .
 aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . 
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ?
 the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon ,
 where steve martin's hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life's riddles are answered in the movies ! "
 even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .

plot : a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth ,
 oops . . . i mean , an evil man .
 he vows revenge on that man and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself ?
 anyway , fourteen years go by and . . .
 arrgh , well , you know the rest . . . swish-swish-zzzzzzz !
 critique : this is a pretty bad movie .
 let's see , where should i start ?
 okay , first of all , the story is just plain boring .
 it's not original , is entirely predictable and lacks energy .
 okay , what's next ? acting , you say .
 hmmmm , well , the main actor , justin chambers , is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o'donnell but with less range ( think about that ! ) ,
 and mena suvari , is just plain off .
 not as bad as thora birch was in dungeons &amp; dragons ,
 but entirely miscast , with bad deliveries , awful sequences and a piss-poor accent that comes and goes . 
now i'm not sure if this was ms . suvari's fault or the director's , 
but i've definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film .
 the only semi-saving grace actor-wise is tim roth as the irrepressible " bad guy " ,
 but once again , it's not something that we haven't seen before . . . a thousand times . . . by the same guy ! !
 tim , please . . . for the love of god , beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day " american roles " for you as a " nice guy " in a romantic comedy or something .
 stretch , dude . . . stretch ! ! 
we all know that you can do much better than this gunk .
 alright , what else was bad in this film ? oh yeah , the score !
 yikes , how's about taking it down a few notches there , fellas ?
 this thing blares in your ear 
whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene , but actually does little more than annoy .
 i think it's important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn't a " real epic " by any stretch of the imagination . 
it's a fluffy rehashed cake-walk created by some " shrewd " studio heads
 who decided to take advantage of the whole " kung-fu " phenomenon in films , and test it out on an old classic .
 dudes . . . you failed all around ! ( keep reading ) 
the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie , the dialogue banal and stilted and the plot problems . . . plentiful !
 ( why does the guy on top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top ? 
why don't they just cut the mouseketeer's rope at the top of the tower ,
 instead of jumping down on their own chords and fighting him while hanging ?
 why doesn't anybody look a day older , when the sequence says " 14 years later " ?
 ( at least . . . change your shirt , man ! )
 keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a " fun time " ,
 but this flick just didn't cut it for me .
 it was boring for stretches ,
 the acting was atrocious at times
 ( the " romantic " scene between suvari and chambers next to the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe ) ,
 there was little reason to care for anyone
 and since when were the musketeers fat ?
 i will give the movie this much , and that is that its main reason for being ( its " raison-d'etre " , as the french would say ) , 
its fight sequences , do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film .
 i was hoping that
 the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer ,
 but what you see there , are essentially the snippets from the two major ( and cool ) swashbuckling sequences from the film .
 the first comes right at the beginning of the movie ,
 while the other essentially finishes the film off , hanging from the tower and juggling off ladders .
 the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper
 but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap .
 and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film's credits ? hullo ?
 the film is called the musketeer and stars a dude name justin chambers .
 deneuve is barely in this movie ! 
ugh , just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash .
 now say it together , gang : " all for one , and one for all . . . we vow to stay away from it all ! ! " thank me later .

best remembered for his understated performance as dr . hannibal lecter in michael mann's forensics thriller , manhunter ,
 scottish character actor brian cox brings something special to every movie he works on .
 usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock
 ( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight ) ,
 he's only occasionally given something meaty and substantial to do .
 if you want to see some brilliant acting , 
check out his work as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach's hidden agenda .
cox plays the role of big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l . i . e . ,
 which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge . 
big john feels the love that dares not speak its name ,
 but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents and bringing them back to his pad .
 what bothered some audience members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light .
 he's an even-tempered , funny , robust old man who actually listens to the kids' problems 
( as opposed to their parents and friends , both caught up in the high-wire act of their own confused lives . ) 
he'll have sex-for-pay with them only after an elaborate courtship , charming them with temptations from the grown-up world .
 l . i . e . stands for long island expressway ,
 which slices through the strip malls and middle-class homes of suburbia .
 filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a ( pretty transparent ) metaphor of dangerous escape for his 15-year old protagonist , howie ( paul franklin dano ) .
 in his opening voice-over , howie reveals a morbid preoccupation with death on the road , citing the l . i . e . highway deaths of filmmaker alan j . pakula , songwriter harry chapin , and his own mother on exit 52 .
 he's both fascinated and disturbed by the l . i . e . ,
 and those feelings are projected onto big john
 ( who follows howie around in his bright red car , but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn't want to do .
 this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies -- 
he's a beast , but ashamed of it . ) 
l . i . e . would have worked best as a half-hour short film about howie's ill-advised foray into big john's haven .
 there is unnecessary padding with howie's miserable dad ( bruce altman ) in the hot seat for a white-collar crime ,
 degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle-class houses , 
and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise-ass gary terrio ( billy kay ) , a handsome artful dodger . 
rather than add to the themes of suburban ennui ( not that we needed another movie on that subject ) ,
 these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length .
 concurrently , the relationship between howie and big john is evenly paced and exceptionally well acted .
 cox , sporting a baseball cap and a faded marine tattoo , is all bluff and bluster .
 dano is quiet and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent .
 we're so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad and obvious ( calling haley joel ! ) ,
 it's surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene .
 the restraint is admirable .
 but l . i . e . 's screenplay doesn't always give them the best material .
 when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem , the moment feels a bit too precious .
 director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john ,
 who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach's goldberg variations .
 it's too much .
 there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john's other boy toy ( walter masterson ) , jealous over the newbie .
 this plot thread predictably leads to violence . 
not content to be a haunting , observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world ( like terry zwigoff's superb ghost world ) ,
 cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work to end on an ambivalent note .
 it's typical of unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet ,
 sparing the writers from actually having to come up with a complex , philosophical note .
 in this regard , l . i . e . ( and countless other indie films ) share something in common with blockbuster action films :
 problems are solved when the obstacle is removed .
 how often does real life work this way ? 
to extend the question : if a movie is striving for realism , do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion ?

janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs
 but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker .
 this is a by-the-books movie 
that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises and very few laughs .
 it also jumps on the ever-popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too .
 garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o . sanders ) running for reelection .
 denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics
 who decides the only way for the scandal- plagued senator to win is to play up his irish roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that's made the kennedy family so popular .
 so leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit .
 she soon learns why " easier said than done " is the mantra of movies like this . 
the matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong --
 garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , can't get a hotel room , ends up in the smallest , trashiest one around , has a dog piss on her luggage , and so on . 
then comes what roger ebert calls the " meet cute . "
 it happens in every romance : 
the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way .
 in the matchmaker , it happens when 
 garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side .
 no points for guessing it's the same dog that just made water on her luggage .
 also no points for guessing garofalo hates o'hara on sight .
 that's how it works in movies like these . 
i know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that
 she'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil ,
 after which they'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . 
i haven't mentioned the movie's twist yet . 
garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival ,
 during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss .
 milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker
 who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together .
 rest assured he'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . 
oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker's utter predictability , 
he dies toward the end . 
what the message here ?
 sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script .
 i was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie ,
 but they actually only have two or three scenes together .
 leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole .
 he even undoes himself with the old microphone's still on after he's done giving the speech cliche . 
both of them should have known better .

and now the high-flying hong kong style of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics ,
 and it isn't pretty .
 this time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas's the three musketeers .
 by bringing in popular asian actor/stunt coordinator xing xing xiong --
 whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- 
our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting .
 the end result is a tepid and dull action/adventure rip-off 
that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu .
 the story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . 
d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . 
he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents .
 in paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) ,
 who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu's man-in-black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks .
 he finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk ,
 so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king's prison .
 d'artagnan and his new frisky love interest/chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers
 until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre ,
 forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day .
 director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles ,
 but here it's a disaster .
 one problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones .
 jet li's high risk is a rip-off of die hard -- not the other way around .
 ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes .
 most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences ,
 because they know the scenes have to carry the picture .
 the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , 
and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader .
 chambers' d'artangnan isn't a musketeer -- 
he's a mouseketeer !
 and hyam's use of candles and torches to light the grime and filth of 17th century paris are well-noted ,
 but that's the only standout in an overall flat production .

a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels .
 first , there's the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie
 . but occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark ,
 the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery .
 no no . . . just kidding .
 had you going there for a moment , didn't i ?
 in all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games .
 the first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament
 that would decide the fate of earth ( and it's 5 billion inhabitants ) .
 the mortals won ,
 and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth .
 unfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser ,
 and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet, 
as our heroes assumed a fighting stance .
 the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself )
 who are fans of the game .
 i'd even go so far as to say that
 many folks who didn't know about the game probably enjoyed the movie .
 the writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself ,
 and they didn't try to overachieve .
 there were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot .
 and , as we know ,
 the movie was a smashing success at the box office .
 mortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where 
that movie left off ,
 with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie .
 shao khan has decided that
 he's going to take over the earth * anyways * ,
 and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament .
 thereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film
 that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid .
 one gets the general impression that 
the producers of the movie thought " hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . "
 too bad they didn't simply stick with the formula from the first movie .
 i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture ,
 but here are the high points :
 * the acting is truly bad .
 sandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable ,
 especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that
 she loved johnny cage 
( a character from the first movie
 who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) .
 * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i've * ever * seen , 
james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder .
 in the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though
 he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics .
 i generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim " tiny " lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) ,
 and remar has always been one of my favorite " utility " actors
 but he's so totally wrong for this part that
 he doesn't even have the luxury of amused self-awareness .
 * there are too many characters
 that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again .
 * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where
 liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) .
 for these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . . . .
 unless you're a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie .
 in that case , the following critiques also apply :
 * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter .
 wilson looked like
 she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer .
 hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . 
* in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing 
they do in the game ( and often more ) .
 sonya does her " kiss of death , "
 jax does his " earthquake , "
 liu kang does his " animality , " and so on .
 a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . 
* there aren't as many fight scenes in this movie as 
there were in the first ,
 because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between .
 silly , silly folks .
 and the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match .
 lame and so obviously sexist 
 even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it .
 * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which
both perform their " animalities . "
 motaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie .
 for folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 .
 you'll probably like it ,
 but not nearly as much as you liked the first one .

 it doesn't much matter and believe me
 by the time " shattered image " runs its painful and pedestrian course 
you won't care .
 these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film
 and the result is 
it's now * twice * as boring as 
it might have been .
 it's not that complicated plots can't be entertaining .
 of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style .
 " shattered image " isn't complex ,
 it's just stupid . and boring .
 parillaud and baldwin , who aren't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that
 their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines .
 lines like : " you don't beg , you insist . i like that in a woman . "
 that's parillaud's character talking . . . to her cat ! 
and : " you're not the reason i couldn't care less about you . " 
huh ?
 and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film : 
" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i'll charm the pants off you . " 
" i don't have that kind of time . " 
talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say " point of no return . "
 we have come to expect this from billy baldwin ,
 but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first .
 but there's nothing to learn .
 karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-me crybaby 
who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer .
 siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine
 who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film's meaningless stock title .
 baldwin seems more interested in parillaud's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her .
 each time graham greene shows up he gets killed .
barbet schroeder ( "reversal of fortune " ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself .
 every now and again it's fun to watch a really bad movie . 
and every now and again , as " shattered image " makes agonizingly clear , it isn't .

john carpenter makes b-movies .
 always has ( " halloween , " " escape from new york , " " the thing " ) and , by the looks of it ( " they live , " " escape from l . a . , " " vampires " ) , always will .
 carpenter's latest horror opus with a science fiction bent ( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titled " john carpenter's ghosts of mars "
 ( in case , i suppose , you went looking for someone else's " ghosts of mars " ) .
 like all those films prefixed by the very possessive " john carpenter's , " 
" ghosts of mars " is an unashamed b-movie punctuated by a b-movie plot , b-movie actors , and b-movie special effects .
 in category one , above , we have a storyline that borders on idiotic ( and , at times , chaotic ) .
 dormant martians ( i . e . , swirling red gases ) awakened by meddling humans possess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes .
 all this explained ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard ( natasha henstridge , from the sub- " species " films ) , the only returnee on a silly-looking train .
officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james " desolation " williams ;
 what she found was not a pretty picture .
 in the second category we have ms . henstridge , her blonde hair pulled back tightly and awkwardly into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-named " desolation " ) , pam grier ( briefly , oddly--who wanted to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extras all assuming 
 that the story and special effects were going to carry this film 
and therefore they didn't need to try too hard .
 in category number three we have , in addition to those swirling red gases and the silly-looking train , a couple of bird's-eye-view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis ( reddish also ) .
 state-of-the-art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark
 and once again the writer/director ( who seems to have no problem finding work , however )  doesn't waste any of the film's budget in that department .
 " ghosts of mars " is lock , laughing stock , and barrel all your standard carpenter fare : dingy interiors , cluttered exteriors , inane dialogue , lots of leather , scarred , crazed-looking aliens , and lots and lots of weaponry .
 the film often and always explodes into warfare without warning--spontaneously , stupidly .
 carpenter might like to think
 he's made a western here
 but it's a western without any real heroes , villains , or border conflicts .
 it's just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken .
 i never thought i'd miss the guy
 but i do .
 it's not * all * the same , however .
 dubbed the " one-note wonder " for his minimalist music soundtracks ,
 carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic ( yet effective ) scoring by highlighting his action with loud , screeching guitar work .
 fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue .
 the final exchange between henstridge and , er , cube though is both audible * and * priceless .
 mars has proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn " mission to mars " and " red planet " ( with val kilmer ) .
 " ghosts of mars " sadly adds to those disappointing returns
 ( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels , among them " american pie 2 " and " rush hour 2 " ) . 
the irony is that
 the mars in carpenter's film feels sadly absent .
 there are occasional references to the red planet , of course ,
 but the film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth's closest neighbor . 
two things keep " john carpenter's ghosts of mars " from getting a huge slap upside the head .
 1 . henstridge keeps her top on ( miraculously ) , and 
2 . the film doesn't pretend to be anything it's not .
 what that means , however , is that fans of superior , intelligent , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularly out of luck .

i'm really starting to wonder about alicia silverstone .
 sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) ,
 but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in ,
 she always strikes out .
 the crush was a slow-moving , predictable piece of fluff .
 hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation 
alicia had only a minor role in .
 clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time .
 and people have e-mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that
 i'm the only one
 who doesn't like it .
 one girl said if i'd seen the movie with " an open mind , "
 i would have enjoyed it .
 nothing could be further from the truth .
i went into the theater expecting to love the movie .
 the preview looked good 
and of course i'm crazymadinlove with alicia ,,
 but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters .
 almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way .
 when we were walking out of the theater , 
one guy ( and it wasn't me ) yelled out , " that was the worst f$&amp;#in' movie i've ever seen " and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement .
 so last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia's pretty face on the cover of some made-for-video thriller called the babysitter .
 i knew it would be bad
 but some inner compulsion i'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway .
 what i got was 90 minutes of regret -- the worst alicia silverstone movie ever .
 and you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like .
 where to begin in criticizing this movie ?
 the plot is a thin shred
 that moves slower than a glacier ,
 the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old ,
 alicia is the star 
and she's still wasted in a movie that has no appeal whatsoever .
 there is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes ,
 when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence .
 zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero .
 so why does this movie get one star out of me ?
 well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub .
 and if it wasn't bubble bath ,
 the babysitter would have instantly joined the ranks of our other four- star features ,
 but you settle for what you can get .
 alicia plays a babysitter
 who's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .
 and of course anyone as beautiful as alicia automatically spends their friday nights at home 
( at least that movie critic at large guy does ) .
 as the movie trods along , we discover
 she's not only the mostly-silent star of the movie but also the object of every male character's fantasies ( and probably every male viewer's too ) .
 the drunken father thinks
 she's just the thing to recapture his lost youth ,
 her boyfriend lets his imagination run wild while spying on alicia from outside , 
even the prepubescent boy looks in on alicia through the bathroom keyhole
 while she's taking her bubble bath .
 they even throw in the middle aged wife's fantasies about a male counterpart at the party . 
not that any of us asked or ever even thought about seeing this 200+ pound woman in a black silk teddy .
at least none of the sex fanatasies ever leave the realm of the pg-rated . 
in fact , i could imagine the babysitter becoming a cinemax late-night staple
 if not for the fact that there's absolutely no nudity in it .
 so you can't call it a sex flick .
 i've already pointed out that it can't fall under drama , comedy , thriller or action ,
 so what do you classify the babysitter as ? bad .

so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci-fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ?
 well , whatever it is , 
you'd sure as hell hope that
 it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange ,
 considering the disastrous results we're left with here .
 this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing !
 it's like i said . . .
 this movie sucks .
 plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 ,
 after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet .
 critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie .
 uneven , would be another .
 the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise ,
 the buzz around it had been so-so ,
 and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes ,
 all leading you to believe that
 it's actually going to go " somewhere " .
 but it isn't long before
 the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry-colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the " pain " of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix .
 in a sci-fi movie ?
 well , i don't know ,
much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half ,
 only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement .
 ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their " misadventures in space " for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti-climactic endings&gt; this side of contact .
 mind you , if you enjoyed that film's shrug-of-the-shoulders ending ,
 you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well .
 of course , i don't remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story .
 ugh . what a friggin' mess .
 films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again .
 didn't anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ?
 didn't they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm ,
 that ain't saying much ! ) .
 of course , you can't really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o'connell in this fine crew of thespians .
 'nuff said .
 neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film's musical score during the last fifteen minutes ,
 presumably in order to wake the audience up 
( okay , we get it brian ,
 this scene is supposed to be powerful
 . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my ears hurt ! ) .
 so is anything salvageable in this movie ? sure .
 gary sinise does another great job ,
 as does cheadle ,
 the film doesn't completely bore you as much as
 it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening ,
 and yes , the " sand-twister " effect that you see in the commercial is well done .
 other than that ?
 i guess i could say that i admire how
 filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . .
 oops , did i say " admire " , i meant " am disgusted " !
 all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two-bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci-fi mumbo-jumbo , pretends to be deep 
when really it's just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending
 which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about
 than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck .
 go see the ninth gate . . .
 now there's a great movie !
 and on a personal note , i think it's time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12-minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .

the law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that
 the two leads must end up together by film's end .
 if you're not familiar with this law ,
 then maybe you've seen the trailer for this film
 which shows that the two leads are together by film's end .
 now if you're a regular reader of mine ,
 you've heard me say this countless times :
 you know how drive me crazy is going to end , 
but is the journey to get to that ending worth it ? no , it definitely is not .
 melissa joan hart ( from abc's " sabrina , the teenage witch " ) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team .
 adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor 
who's just broken up with his activist girlfriend .
 apparently he wants to make his ex-girlfriend jealous enough to take him back ,
 and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance . 
so the two pretend to date for some reason ,
 but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud .
 will grenier like his new popularity and turn on his friends ?
 will this crazy scheme work ?
 do i care ?
 the teen comedy resurgence of late has been surprisingly good in terms of comedy .
 what makes movies like can't hardly wait and 10 things i hate about you work ( and to a lesser extent , she's all that and never been kissed ) is 
because the writers of those films seem to realize that
 high school is a joke
 and write their scripts accordingly .
 i don't know what the writer's intention was with drive me crazy .
 there was some smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to .
 here there's nothing . . .
 just teens whining about who's going to take them to the big dance .
 do me a favor kids ,
 go get a job or something . . .
 just shut the hell up .
 in all honesty , the best part of this film is the end credits .
 now normally when i say that it's followed with the joke " . . . because the movie is finally over . "
 in this case though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film .
 after the obligatory second playing of britney spears' titular song ,
 there's a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids in the film hang out in and a brief rendition of the school song for their high school .
 nothing great , but more entertaining than anything in the 90 minutes which preceded them .
 sci-fi fans take note :
 there are brief appearances from stephen collins ( star trek : the motion picture ) and faye grant ( the tv miniseries " v " and " v : the final battle " ) . [pg-13]

mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before
 we actually get to see a great big gorilla .
 his entrance , however , is a grand one :
 out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have .
 joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that
 they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars .
 during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow . that's some ape . " 
joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla .
 he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people .
 he picks things up and stares at them pensively .
 he breaks things on accident , 
because he's just too big to avoid clumsiness .
 joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .
 as a character , he doesn't quite register .
 and the story he's been put in is as limp as they come .
 the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , 
but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart .
 the picture is a remake of the 1949 film .
 it's mostly just about the big gorilla , 
but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters .
 the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas .
 as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ;
 now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife .
 specifically , she's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla
 who has been her friend since her childhood .
 soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ;
 he quickly realizes that
 poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) ,
 who just happens to be the same guy
 who killed jill's mother .
 so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve ,
 where it is instantly clear that
 he is not safe from poachers .
 in addition , the space is way too small for him
 ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) .
 and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext
 ( he tells jill that
 he has a preserve big enough for joe ) ,
 and joe recognizes strasser as the guy
 who killed jill's mother .
 jill , of course , doesn't recognize strasser ,
 even though he did kill her mother .
 this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young ,
 a film that fulfills every stereotype
 that comes with a special effects film .
 the movie isn't really offensive --
 it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla .
 but the story is really dumb ,
 there aren't any characters ,
 and the film isn't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals .
 the movie also has bad dialogue .
 if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue ,
 it's only fair to quote some of it , 
but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe isn't happy ! " and " joe isn't safe here ! " " we need to get joe out of here ! " " joe is way too big for that cage ! "
 i don't know if these phrases are word for word ,
 but they're close .
 as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality :
 they do little more than state the obvious
 ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . 
paxton and theron are talented performers
 who deserve to work on a script
 that provides characters for them .
 sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both .
 there are a few clever moments
 ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) ,
 and , as i said , 
the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes .
 it's certainly not a bad film for kids ;
 i doubt joe will give them nightmares .
 but adults in the audience aren't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla .
 a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ;
 after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla .
 nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

" spawn " features good guys , bad guys , lots of fighting , bloody violence , a leather-clad machine gun chick , gooey , self-healing bullet holes , scatological humor and a man-eating monster .
 it not only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boys ,
 it appears to have been made by them .
 in a classic example of telling and not showing ,
 " spawn " opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness , forces of light and how " men are the ones who create evil on earth . "
 so much for a message .
 the movie then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government assassin/operative 
who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant .
 simmons goes to hell and back , after making a deal with satan himself --
 if he agrees to command the devil's army to overtake the world , 
he'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda ( underused theresa randle ) and little girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) .
 of course , seeing as how five years has passed ,
 wanda has fallen for -- and married -- simmons' partner ( d . b . sweeney ) .
 his , uh , shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan's .
 clown manipulates simmons , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn .
 wynn , who thinks he is in league with the double-dealing clown , recognizes spawn as a threat and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart --
 when it stops beating ,
 major cities around the world will detonate ,
 causing the leak of a disease that " makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash . "
 phew . 
got all that ?
 it would be easy to dismiss " spawn " as just another one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-substance action pics ,
 but it doesn't even work on that level .
 the computer-generated sequences are often and plenty ,
 and the problem is that
 they look too computer-generated .
 the several scenes set in hell present a devil
 that looks and acts like a video game graphic -- 
with the movie's healthy budget you'd think 
they could have afforded to make his mouth move when he talks .
 other elements of the movie are so-so ;
 spawn's enormous red , flowing cape is a wonderful sight , 
 but it's too obvious when
 he's being played by a costumed actor or an image .
 in movies like " contact , " the special effects serve the story .
 in " spawn , " they are the story . 
and spawn himself isn't even an interesting character .
 the film's reliance on razzle-dazzle would be acceptable
 if we were given somebody to root for ,
 but both simmons and his funky alter-ego are completely underdeveloped .
 what we need is a batman , a luke skywalker .
 even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn .
 poor leguizamo .
 he starred in february's " the pest , "
 a movie that i still think is the year's worst so far ,
 although this one does give it a run for its money .
 as clown , he overacts to the extreme , never missing an opportunity for a poor-taste punchline .
 leguizamo farts green mist , munches a pizza slice covered with maggots and even dons a mini-skirt and performs a cheerleader routine , all before turning into a giant grey demon .
 the guy was brilliant in " to wong foo , thanks for everything ! julie newmar . "
 what is he doing wasting his talent in this and " the pest " ?
 i'm one of the few people that liked " batman &amp; robin , " this summer's other big-budget comic book film . 
yet after catching this movie and making the inevitable comparison ,,
 i can only hope people will change their minds and think of " batman " as the superior adaptation . 
there's a compelling story somewhere in " spawn " -- including strong religious overtones and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it's just not found anywhere near here .
 as it is , " spawn " is just awful --
 it stinks worse than a dead trout .

" in dreams " might keep you awake at night ,
 but not because of its creepy imagery , bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman
 who lures young girls to their untimely deaths .

 no , the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie's brutally squandered potential ,
 the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise - even by tired serial killer genre standards .
 the big letdown , however , comes upon the realization that 
this 100-minute head-scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan , the man behind " the crying game . "
 he's no stranger to cinematic weirdness ,
 but this nutty nonsense really pushes the envelope .
things start out strong enough , 
with cinematographer darius khondji's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue
 that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat .
 this eerie opulence remains a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film -
 there's even something macabre about the way
 khondji photographs a rustic , seemingly innocent new england autumn -
 but if there ever was &gt;a film that didn't deserve so good a polish ,
 it's this one .
 don't knock the look ,
 but say what you will about the foolish plot , underdeveloped characters and flat dialogue .
annette bening ,
 another asset " in dreams " shouldn't be so lucky to boast ,
gives an increasingly effective performance in a role
 that doesn't do much for her in return .
 she plays claire cooper , a massachusetts children's book illustrator
 who's plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children .
 she thinks these visions are a warning knell for horrible , soon-to-be-committed crimes ,
 but neither her ho-hum husband ( aidan quinn ) nor the ho-hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously .
 this being a thriller , we know that
 she is , in fact , on the money ,
 and it's a credit to bening's acting that
 she delves equally into claire's madness and compassion .
 but as soon as a body turns up 
and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims ,
 " in dreams " trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts
 that simply refuse to make sense .
 scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition .
subplots appear and disappear .
 when claire finally comes face-to-face with our evil murderer ( robert downey jr . ) ,
 it turns out his name is vivian ,
 he's clairvoyant 
and he's got some major issues with mama , a la norman bates .
 " in dreams " reaches its absurdist zenith here ,
 and the climax  drags with mumbled revelations and laughable twists .
 some questions , then : what's with the garbage disposal retching applesauce ? 
are the drawings on the wall blood or paint ? 
who cranked up the andrews sisters on the cd player and caused the swing to move on its own ?
 what about the computer ? 
does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers ?
 why would he continually endanger claire 
if she was necessary for his ultimate plan ?
 is the woman in australia integral to anything ?
 and the aforementioned flooded city - what function does that _really_ serve ?
 sigh .
 at least in my own dreams ,
&gt; i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn't go to waste .

" knock off " is exactly that : a cheap knock off of an action movie .
 it's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year .
i figured it would be at least a couple of months before
 i saw the worst film of 1998 ,
 but alas , it has already been found .
 jean-claude van damme stars as ( i think ) a designer jeans executive
 who discovers his half-brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods .
 rob schneider plays van damme's partner ,
 and rochon plays . . .
 actually , i have no idea 
who rochon was supposed to be . 
she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation
 as to why she was there .
 many things are not explained in this film , but i do know that
 for some bizarre reason , van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick .
 where chan comes off as endearing in his " normal guy " character seen in many of his films , 
van damme just comes off as a wimp .
 we're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions .
 to be more clear : i did not even know who
 he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie ,
 and even then , it was not made too clear .
 the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong .
tsui hark ( who directed van damme's last movie , the bad , but not nearly as bad as this , " double team " ) never lets the camera rest for a second ,
 and that's no exaggeration .
 we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme's foot entering a shoe .
 fabulous !
 seriously , though , i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions ,
 as long as they don't get carried away .
 for example , look at sam raimi .
 " army of darkness " , one of his best movies , features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen ,
 but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story .
 that's a concept that tsui can't seem to grasp .
 the special effects and outrageous camera angles * rule * "  knock off " to the point where
 the audience doesn't have a clue as to what's happening any more .
 another problem with the film is that 
it looks cheap .
 the film stock used is of such low caliber that
 i thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night .
 and for some inexplicable reason , everyone's voice seems to have been dubbed .
 even the stars .
and even the special effects , seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about , are inconsistent .
 for example , there is a scene in which
 van damme drives a car out of a window .
 the car slams into the ground ,
 and the left wheel is completely destroyed .
 seconds later , the car drives off at full speed .
 hey , i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie ,
 but a line must be drawn somewhere .
 finally , the acting .
 nobody gives a good performance in this film .
 van damme , an actor i usually like , is way off the mark playing " everyman " .
 and schneider , here to provide comic relief i assume , is totally unfunny and over acts his way through every scene .
 even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over-the-top performance as . . .
 once again , i have no idea 
who he was supposed to be .
 in case i haven't yet made it clear enough ,
 " knock off " is the worst movie of van damme's career and possibly the worst movie of the decade .
 and it's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's funny .
 it's too inept to be funny .
 there are no redeeming factors in " knock off "
 and i seriously hope that
 every print of this film is burned to a crisp 
and that somehow my memory of watching the film can be erased .

" snake eyes " is the most aggravating kind of movie :
 the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing .
 it's not just because
 this is a brian depalma film ,
 and since he's a great director 
and one who's films are always greeted with at least some fanfare .
 and it's not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage
 and since he gives a brauvara performance , 
this film is hardly worth his talents . 
it's worse than that .
 it's aggravating for the sole reason that
 its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent ,
 and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that
 it will be handled complexly and intensely . . .
 then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that
 leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness .
 or more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness .
 in certain circles , " snake eyes " was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa's classic " rashomon , "
 where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives ,
 and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening ,
 which , i might add , is superb .
 in one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match
 as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who's character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who's also in this ) , and watches as it happens .
 there's a big name in the crowd ,
 and that's the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) ,
 who's sitting behind rick , 
and who gets shot
 a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out .
 this all happens in the opening shot , 
and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that 
it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . 
what really happened , this film asks ,
 and it sets this film up extremely well for when
 rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and discovers there's a very good possibility it was a conspiracy .
 as we follow rick trying to learn of more information ,
 we also meet a woman
 who was talking to kirkland
 before he was shot ( carla gugino ) ,
 and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel 
since the cops have blocked off the doors
 so they can get witness' takes on what happened .
 this is all going pretty fine and dandy ,
 and it's extremely interesting to watch . . . 
then it takes one wrong step .
 we follow the wrong character ,
 and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , 
and way before rick can find it out .
 but that's not the worst part of it :
 it's that it's the one person you didn't think it would be
 because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring ,
 the one you didn't think did it 
because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it .
 it only gets worse :
 the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film ,
 and since we already know what happened ,
 we can't rely on rick's investigation to be all that interesting .
 it's as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out ,
 and that just happens to mean that
 it has to become less and less credible .
 events become more and more proposterous ,
 and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina .
 that's where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay .
 this time , it's a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena .
 what went wrong ?
 depalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . 
depalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , " blow out , "
 where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece .
 but granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning 
and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries .
 at least his direction makes up partly for it .
 then there's koepp ,
 who showed such great ability at making a character's flaws come to life 
like he did in depalma's earlier " carlito's way , " 
a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well .
 he can write a flawed character ,
 but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort .
 he's flawed ,
 and we can see redemption
 if the story wasn't so formulaic .
 a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that 
his answer has no emotional buildup .
 he may as well have said the opposite of what he says ;
 it would have at least gone with what the character was like .
 this is the most disappointing kind of film because 
it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption ,
 then pulls the rug from under us 
just as we were about to be convinced 
it would be able to go all the way .
 as i was watching the first half hour ,
 i couldn't wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed ,
 how many different perspectives he'd be given ,
 and perhaps he'd have to make a choice between who's he has to believe .
now there's a film .
 unfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when
 the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap
 we've seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma .

forgive the fevered criticism
 but the fervor of the crucible infects .
 set in 1692 at salem , massachusetts ,
 the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon .
 they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells .
 then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes .
 not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor ( daniel day lewis ) ,
 abigail ( winona ryder ) suddenly seizes a chicken , beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood .
 taking even adolescent hormone surges into account , surely this chicken-bashing bit is a bit excessive , especially for prim puritan sensibilities ? 
surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets ?
 the crucible errs from the beginning
 and arthur miller's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play .
 this is far from a harmless event , a bad start to an already shaky morality tale .
 the play describes the film's opening scene during tense exchanges 
that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply , 
and this adds to the play's charged atmosphere .
 in the film , the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora's box .
 not only is credulity stretched
 but abigail's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted .
 it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts ;
 it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot .
 not surprisingly , the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed
 and when two girls fail to wake the following morning ,
 witches are invoked by those eager to blame .
 when the girls are questioned ,
 their confession of guilt is accompanied with an announcement of their return to god 
and they are thereafter converted to immaculate witnesses , led lustfully by abigail .
 with alarming synchronicity our hormonally-advantaged girls zealously gesture and point accusing fingers at innocents ,
 constant reminders that abigail's passion sets all this into inexorable motion .
 abigail seizes on this opportunity to rid herself of her rival for john proctor's love , his wife elizabeth ( joan allen ) , by including her among those accused of witchcraft .
 appropriately narrow-waisted and equipped with a distractingly white smile ( watch his teeth deteriorate much too quickly to a murky yellow ) , day lewis plays the dashing moral hero with an over-earnestness that longs to be watched .
 director nicholas hytner is guilty of encouraging day lewis' foaming-mouth fervour 
with shots where we stare up at proctor
 as if he was mounted on a pedestal for our admiration . 
otherwise , hytner's direction is unremarkable .
 ryder's performance as abigail is as consistent as her mood swings .
 her fits of frenzy are energetic enough but the quieter moments are less successful .
 abigail supposedly revels in her newfound power ,
 but ryder fails at being convincingly haughty
 although there is much haughtiness to spare here .
 paul scofield is fine as the overzealous judge danforth ,
 but the incessant moral posturings of all the characters along with the recurrent histrionics of the young girls pricks at the nerves .
 probably because she is the only refuge of restraint amidst all the huffing and puffing ,
 allen's elizabeth comes out as the most sympathetic character .
 a scene near the end featuring a private conversation between the imprisoned elizabeth and john is undeniably powerful
 because for once we are given a reprieve from the moral bantering and the human consequences are revealed . 
unfortunately , when john's audience again increases to more than one 
his urge to pontificate returns
 and the human urgency of his situation is lost .
 it is clear that
 miller meant well 
but i do wish he did it with more delicacy and fewer diversions .
 his screenplay is an imperfect creature
 with the distractions coming out as loud as the message .
 the result is a clumsy muddle -
 i felt like the chicken from the opening scene , head ceaselessly banged with piousness too heavy-handed to be wholly believable .
 when the gallows beckoned , it was sweet release indeed .
 far from bewitching , the crucible tests the patience .

one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .
 after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .
 he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .
 however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .
the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit ,
 to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .
 these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .
 it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : 
" it's only when things are over that they make sense . "
whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . 
the thesis is simple enough that , if played right ,
 it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . 
instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes ,
 the next scene no more engaging than the last .
 only once does any character utter something worthwhile ,
 but by the time it happens
 you're so thoroughly bored
 you can easily miss it .
 but don't fret ,
 it will surface again .
 you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .
 but you hold hope for some time .
 the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .
 it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that
 you lose all hope .
 and with speeches like , " i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "
 how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ?
 to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .
 the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . 
watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain
 makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . 
and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have ,
 which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .
 the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail ,
 but the script never complements them .
 unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .
 sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings ,
 but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .
 the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .
 you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . 
the only scene that makes any sense is one 
that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .
 steven spielberg is picked on in particular .
 while i'll grant that this does happen , 
and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , 
it's still a pointless focus for a film
that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .
 it just goes to show ,
 an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
 the days of breathless are no more .

america loves convenience .
 after all , we're the culture 
that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control .
 yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far .
 ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home .
 when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered ,
 they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches .
 filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes ,
 ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences .
 the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .
 ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie ,
 ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next ,
 stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose .
 attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .
 most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , 
dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube .
 with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other ,
 cube reminisces about his street life ,
 comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . "
 apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that
 the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .
 but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .
 yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars ,
 but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .
 and as we all know ,
 every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .
 characters die , heads are lopped off ,
 but they were only supporting roles anyway ,
 so why should we care ?
 as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .
 eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .
 what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle . 
explosions are fun .
 and even if the nukes don't get them ,
 the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .
 in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? "
 for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say ,
 and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .

reindeer games is easily the worst 
of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others ,
 each derivative in their own special way ) .
 the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue
 ( sample from reindeer games : " rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel " ) ,  create multi-faceted characters , or even  engineer coherent plots
 but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns
 ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .
 his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that
 watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .
 i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , 
" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! "
 it's almost as if
 the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .
 and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie
 when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules
 for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?
 auteur theory be damned ;
 it's kruger's " style " , not the director's that winds up on screen .
 kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut " sometimes less is more " .
 and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ;
 arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view ,
 and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ;
 character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the " character " . . . grammar be damned ) . 
" how did you know that ? " the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that 
the character was in on the whole thing all along . . .
 since twist endings are currently so in vogue ,
 and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending ,
 i guess it's no wonder why
 he works so frequently .
 he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ;
 the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .
 this is appropriate considering that
 miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .
 their company's current logo could be " we ride the trends " .
 reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .
 although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness ,
 he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .
 affleck is such a puppy dog that 
it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .
 the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that
 this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent " serious " movie getting .
 it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )
 james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer
 who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .
 ashley is a prison groupie
 who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her
 though she's never seen one picture of him .
 which works out fine
 since the character is killed in a near-riot ,
 and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place ,
 which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) ,
 who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .
 he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy
 who he thinks is nick
 who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .
 though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that
 everything i've described might as well be irrelevant .
 this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ;
 several scenes in which , after catching his prey ,
 the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably 
until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .
 included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero
 when they should be killing him
 ( one following the other no less ) .
 though it's an action film ,
 the ending is more a talkfest where
 we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another
 while affleck looks on , incredulous  as the audience .
 the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director
 who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .
 it would be a success story if
 he were choosing better scripts
 but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies )
 which followed the island of dr . morneau ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .
 he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting 
which i like considering that 
nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .
 problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play . character problems abound ;
 rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre ,
 the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .
 the former he can do with ease
 and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm 
while those around him growl and swear .
 but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .
 charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part 
the script requires her to play ,
 whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .
 she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes 
( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .
 gary sinise has played this role frequently , 
and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that
 going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that 
it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .
 these are talented people
 who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that
 it dully springs on its audience .

a follow-up to disney's live-action " 101 dalmatians " that's better , more entertaining than the first ? just as unlikely .
 with " 102 dalmatians , " the disney studios have proven that
 when it comes to going to the dogs ,
 more is definitely * not * the merrier .
 1996's " 101 dalmatians " certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time ,
 but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance .
 in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies .
 this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen ,
 and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers .
 but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film .
 what makes " 102 dalmatians " such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly  or="-1"&gt;wooden actors
 who plays the romantic " heroes " of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . 
gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps ,
 but evans can't even aspire to that .
 the dogs upstage them both , of course ,
 but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated .
 bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel ,
 since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in " men of honor . "
 jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs
 and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail .
 france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself ,
 and in " 102 dalmatians " the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--
le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as " poopies , " par example ( and ad nauseum ) .
 the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with ,
 since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) .
 that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown .
 the dogs are pretty cute
--try making a puppy look otherwise--
but that's pretty much all they are .
 there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder .
 savvy holiday goers should skip " 102 dalmatians " and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead .
 it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying .

one-sided " doom and gloom " documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible .
 orson welles narrates and appears in the film
 in which he , along with best-selling author hal lindsey , discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent ( well for 1976 anyway ) events .
 the film is dated badly ,
 as many things that are supposed to happen in the " future " never do .
 for example , the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth . 
we're still here .
 the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick-off the apocalypse . we're still here .
 some of the more ludicrous moments come
 when it's alluded to that
 people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist ( ! ) . 
also , there's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like .
 if it's anything like
 it's depicted as here then 
it's going to be incredibly boring .
 the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video .
 it contains the film in standard form ( aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 ) ,
 although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed .
 also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey , as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release , chariots of the gods .
 audio is mono dolby digital , 
and the video is fair to good for a film like this .
 i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format
 so any condition at all is fine with me .
 certainly i never expected a remastered print . 
curiously , the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case .
 but they're menu screens . . . so who really cares ? [pg]

play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .
 like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) ,
 this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .
shelton's films are not considered sports films ,
 but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .
 shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that
 from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .
 play it to the bone is unsuccessful because
 not only is the boxing theme dull ,
 but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .
 the film has no social message like its predecessors .
 the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .
the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .
 unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .
 1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .
 the two are so different from each other , that
 a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .
 2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .
 there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .
 3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .
she is in nearly every scene with them ,
 making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have
 when they fight each other .
 4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .
 vince is convinced that
 he sees jesus on a regular basis ,
 cesar yells at the sky in spanish when
 he is angry ,
 and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .
 these boring tales only hurt the central plot .
 5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight ,
 they don't even hesitate to pound each other .
 wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends
 who could never hurt each other ?
 by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with ,
 the film wants to be over .
 shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .
 forty five painful minutes remain .
 the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .
 however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .

some movies i should just skip .
 my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back ,
 and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .
 true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time ,
 and it's a cartoon .
 but it's a cartoon i liked ,
 and i was understandably reluctant to see
 what disney had done to it on the big screen .
 but my daughter really wanted to go , 
and how bad could it be ?
 turns out i was right , mostly .
 inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .
 at first i thought
 it was done by the same people ,
 but imdb informs me that
 ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin ,
 where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .
 this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio
 that produced it ,
 where " formula " isn't just business ,
 it's a way of life .
 the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .
 in some parts you can just hear them saying " more zany ! i want more zany here -- and -- here . "
 " let's have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . i want the audience squirming in their seats . "
 " ok , that's fine , but i want you to add bug guts . "
 " what does this scene do ? character depth ? but where's the zaniness ? i don't see zany here . if you can't make it zany , cut it ! "
 the latter is the only explanation i can come up with for the absence of the thoroughly charming michelle trachtenberg for most of the movie .
 michelle ( who plays penny , gadget's niece ) shines in every scene she's in ,
 but unfortunately she only gets about nine minutes of screen time . 
my guess is that the rest is on the cutting room floor .
 dabney coleman's comedic talents are utterly wasted as chief quimby .
i kept expecting him to say or do something really funny and somehow save the film ,
 but instead , he does the best he can with some really poor lines in a few unexceptional scenes .
 he is thoroughly upstaged by cheri oteri as the " gidget bitch from hell " town mayor .
 oteri's overly enthusiastic and continually self-congratulatory speech patterns and mannerisms were so much like portland , oregon's own manic mayor vera katz that
 i had to wonder if 
the studio wasn't poking fun at our fair town .
 or , maybe all career politicians are like that .
i must say ,
 matthew broderick does not stroll through inspector gadget
 as he did godzilla .
 he appears to have some fun with the film , especially as the evil gadget .
 rupert everett is entertaining as the maniacle claw .
 joely fisher does fine as the zany scientist and even better as the zany carbon copy of herself .
 her performance is one of the few things worth watching in the film .
 d . l . hughley plays the shuckin'-and-jivin' vehicular side-kick ,
 in a role that firmly sets emancipation back 20 years .
 the dialog is . . . let's face it ,
 it's pretty bad .
 the tag-line after a major set-piece battle is a faux pas
 that makes no sense in context .
 a lot of the lines ( especially hughley's ) appear to be made up as they go along , by people with little gift for ad-lib .
 about three-quarters of the film is a somewhat unnecessary origin story for both gadget and claw .
 gadget then spends the latter third of the movie trying to locate claw and having various altercations ( not really " battles " ) with the evil gadget .
 penny does about a minute and a half of the detective work
her character did every week in the cartoon .
 let me rage here just for a minute .
 michelle trachtenberg was an excellent choice for the penny character .
 she's utterly charming , and has excellent experience ( harriet the spy ) for the part of the pint-size detective .
 why she is so underutilized in this film is a real mystery .
 the film loses a star for casting brilliance coupled with scripting ( or editing ) stupidity .
 inspector gadget is missing the long , long stretches of potty humor
 that ( among other things ) made my favorite martian so unbearable ,
 but it's a very short movie ,
 so perhaps something was cut at the last moment .
 probably the best scenes in the film occur during the end credits .
 the " evil sidekick support group " is especially worth seeing , and has an amazing number of cameo appearances for the few seconds it's onscreen .
 all in all , another bad live action film from the premere studio for bad live action films .
 i wonder if 
disney uses the revenues for it's generally money-making cartoons to produce these losers .
 but if true , why ?
 if they're trying for another &gt;mary poppins ,
 they need to find a team that can produce one , and then give them a chance to do it .

hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell .
 the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures
 that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films .
 in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous .
 with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership ,
 a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions .
 such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna &amp; the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results .
 now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai .
 unfortunately " romeo must die " bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms .
 the film opens in a nightclub as
 an asian couple is necking .
 enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .
 kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family .
 a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai ,
 who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . 
it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that
 the fight ends .
 the following morning po sing is found dead .
 suspicions escalate ,
 as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .
 his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .
 issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .
 the scene shifts to a prison in china ,
 where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .
 he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .
 hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody
 in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .
 escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death .
 " romeo must die " is in many ways a fun film .
 it is both absurd and assured .
 the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes " the godfather " .
 the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's " china girl " ,
 except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .
 their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .
the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .
 li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .
 allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .
it's obvious that
 the camera loves her 
and she is very photogenic .
 but , still the part is under written in such a way that
 even a poor performance would not have affected it .
 delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . 
an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance .
 the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin . 
the performance is undirected ,
 with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .
 an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .
 first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .
 having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers ,
 bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots ,
 and " romeo must die " does look good .
 but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .
 the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that
 we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .
 the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .
 and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here 
as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .
 the best things about the film are its fight scenes .
 jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . 
one needs only to see his film " fist of legend " to understand that
 the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat . 
here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that
 " lethal weapon 4 " ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow .
 unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects
 that detract from his ability and precision .
 also " romeo must die " must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film ,
 and that is an x-ray effect 
that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . 
obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's " streetfighter " , 
the scenes here are just pointless and  interfere with the pacing of the film .
 it's as if the film has stopped
 and a video game has been inserted . 
one problem though about the fight scenes .
 those that are familiar with hong kong action know that
 even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .
 they do have an internal rhythm to them .
 a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .
 the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .
 this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .
 here in " romeo must die " , there is no staccato .
 every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring
 as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern .
 the rhythm is monotonous .
 a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact .
 'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .
 a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . .
 watch the restaurant fight from the film " rush hour " and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat 
( the framing and cut always do not help ) .
 now look at the warehouse fight from " rumble in the bronx " .
there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw
 that doesn't let the audience catch its breath .
 the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted .
 here in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl .
 jet li is a grand and personable screen presence .
 it's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here .
 one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion
 that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .
 until then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like " the replacement killer " and , currently " romeo must die " .

i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film .
 i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! we'll have a hit on our hands ! "
 the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography .
the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels .
 keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption .
 gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . 
rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors
 who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders .
 this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays ,
 gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , 
keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field ,
 and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny's .
 the usual things happen like clockwork .
 the hero rises from the ashes of failure ,
 the team comes together in unity ,
 the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest ,
 the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap ,
 and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax .
 it's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .
 howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes .
 obviously the problem is that without a good script ,
 any director will fail in the end .
 sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . 
the replacements offers none of this .

if you're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers ,
 then " bully " 's for you .
 based on jim schutze's novelization of a true-life event , 
" bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers
 who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood .
 the film could have provided fascinating insights into
 what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers .
 in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however ,
 it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities .
 in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new .
 the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane .
 the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work
 but he doesn't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department .
 he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro )
 and marty's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) doesn't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby .
 simply remove him from the equation .
 marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal
 where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off .
 there's no remorse--
the next day they're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment .
 they did it
 because they wanted to ,
 and because they could .
 what's most troubling about the film , however , isn't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which
 clark is constantly distracted by his own material .
 not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully "
 but there's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it . 
gratuitous crotch shots abound
 ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) .
clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that
 you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about .
 the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors 
( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time ,
 as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera .
 the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime .
 it's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--
but it's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it .
 " bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death .

sean connery stars as a harvard law professor
 who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) .
 the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that
 his confession was coerced from the region's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) .
 watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough ,
 but the plot's a joke .
 there's no logic at work here .
 tone is also an issue -- there is none .
 director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what 
his film is trying to say .
 is it a statement on human rights ? 
is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ?
 glimcher never tells .
 instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that
 the audience won't notice what's missing .
 just awful .

among multitude of erotic thrillers , that had been released in the early 1990s ,
 woman of desire is interesting only
 because it was directed by robert ginty , star of the b-grade action films of the previous decade .
 those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies
 that made ginty the star .
 as director , ginty did very little to improve that impression .
 the protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper
 that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) .
 however , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) .
 one stormy night , the tragedy occurs
 and jack is accused of rape and murder . 
however , his good friend walter j . hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer ,
 so jack might even prove his innocence in the end .
 belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller ,
 woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films 
by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots .
 unfortunately , this film isn't comedy
 and any laugh is unintentional .
 the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating 
and soon we stop caring what would happen to them .
 the actors that play them don't  or="1" neg="1"&gt;help either .
 that is especially the case with jeff fahey ,
 whose jack is so stupid that 
even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison .
 his partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that
 she didn't age enough to cease being the sex goddess ,
 but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . 
ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie
 by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , 
but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .

" lake placid " marks yet another entry in the series of " predator pics "
 that were a screen staple in the late 1970s ( post- " jaws " ) and were revived recently by the godawful " anaconda . "
 " placid " claims to be a " horror/comedy " -
it's directed by the same guy
who did " house " -
but its attempts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of " anaconda . "
 paleontologist kelly scott ( bridget fonda ) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body
 that had been bitten in half on the lake .
 discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile
 ( which shouldn't even be in this hemisphere ) ,
 kelly goes croc-hunting with game warden jack wells ( bill pullman ) and sheriff hank keough ( brendan gleeson ) .
 they're joined by an unwelcome guest , hector cyr ( oliver platt ) , a scholar
 who worships crocs and searches all over the world for them .
 along the way , the merry band meets mrs . delores bickerman ( betty white ) , a weird old lady
 who lives out on the lake .
 you know what to expect from this movie : lots of shots 
where the camera is the eyes of the predator ( croc cam ) swimming toward someone's dangling legs 
while " jaws " -like music plays , 
one character ( hector ) who's obsessed with the croc and stupidly endangers the rest ,
 another character who insists that
 the predator can't possibly exist .
 unlike its slippery cousin " anaconda , "
 " lake placid " wants to present its formulaic plot tongue-in-cheek ,
 which is self-defeating .
 the result is neither scary nor funny ;
 it's just tedious .
 while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume ( including two installments of " friday the 13th " and " halloween h20 " ) ,
 screenwriter david kelley ( best known as the creator of tv series like " ally mcbeal " and " chicago hope " ) doesn't seem to have the stomach for a chomp 'em up flick .
 the body count is surprisingly low and doesn't include any of the major characters ,
 and most annoyingly kelly and hector insist that
 they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it . 
( " lake placid " manages to have it both ways-
i'll let you discover how for yourself ) .
 the croc itself is mostly computer-generated , of course .
 like the snake in " anaconda , " 
the thirty-foot monster crocodile doesn't seem real ;
 it moves too quickly and in ways that seem unnatural . "
 lake placid " also offers little explanation for why
 a giant crocodile is in maine .
 there is a lot of semi-mystical mumbo jumbo about how " we really don't know much about crocodiles . "
 they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers .
 a movie like this doesn't have to offer much of an explanation ( radioactive mutant ? creature from outer space ? ) ,
 but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief on .
 pullman and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto-pilot .
 most of the time , they're probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if
 making this movie marks the end of their careers .
 platt and white , on the other hand , seem to be giving their best efforts ,
 and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script .

capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ?
 starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that .
 it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun :
 it's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that
 even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed .
 it's one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time .
 why am i calling this movie pornography ?
 pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts .
 i remember reading a review of full metal jacket 
which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , 
where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " .
 i didn't agree with that assessment ,
 but i could see what was being implied :
 the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do 'er , man , do 'er ! " 
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers .
 it's * literally * like a giant recruitment film
 that has gone berserk .
 it tries frantically to enlist our emotions
 but it winds up only being dull or sickening .
 the film takes place in our future , when
 earth has come under attack by some alien species
 that doesn't appear to have intelligence .
 to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : 
instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they're clearly capable of , 
they send down grunts with m-16 rifles .
 this isn't heinlein ,
 it's a bad wwii movie ,
 one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes
 that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome .
 ( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability :
 said cameraman gets skewered , too . )
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic .
 they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense .
 they don't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * ,
 and therefore we don't care about them .
 we hated the tom berenger character in platoon ,
 but he * mattered * ,
 and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate .
 here , we don't even hate the bugs --
 what's there to hate ?
 hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine .
 if there's anything really hateful there ,
 the movie doesn't know how to give it to us .
 the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director  ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make
 the characters or the story serve each other .
 one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot
 who's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again .
 once or twice is fine .
 by the fifth or sixth time , it's worn out its welcome .
 there's never any sense that 
these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle .
 also , the movie is irritatingly selective with
 how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry . 
if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp ,
 then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing .
 but if one human gets cornered ,
 he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip .
 uh-huh .
 the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor .
 i say " quasi- " because
 while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- 
the movie doesn't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject .
 the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that
 they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison .
 like the rest of the movie .
 there's more , i suppose ,
 but it's not worth it .
 the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ;
 the music disposable ;
 the camerawork turgid .
 the heartbreaking thing is that 
it makes independence day look like a masterpiece .

the classic story &amp; the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic ,
 new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make-up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel .
 of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies ,
 one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls
 ( sounds like a much better title . . ) .
 the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific ,
 who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after
 his plane crashes into the sea .
douglas soon learns that
 montgomery is working for dr . moreau ,
 who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist 
who has been awarded the nobel prize .
 his host's reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when
 he stumbled into moreau's lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress .
 even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal " people . " 
douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when
 he is led to the beast-people community ,
 which considers dr . moreau their maker .
 using shock-therapy and the law ,
 dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast-people civilised to some extent
 but there are a few animal-men who are just too savage to be controlled .
 the island of dr . moreau questions the ability of men playing god .
 dr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings
 which is free from hate and violence . . .
 but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long .
 moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp .
 even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it .
 there are too many characters to put your attention to 
and the worst thing is ,
 the characters are not " prioritized " so
 when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important ,
 before they know it ,
 he or she or it perishes . . . . rather ungloriously at times too .
 perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau's creations .
 the two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all
 and it is in this area that
 the script fails miserably .
 more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development .
 i really would have liked it better if , say ,
 they delved more into dr . moreau's obsession , montgomery's purpose in the story and justification to as why
 the beast-people had to rebel .
 maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to " cut a long story short " and make it more of an action film than anything else 
( it's still summer , and movies have to be " marketable " ) .
 the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about .
 at most , i would say the beast-men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes .
 this h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film .
 unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message
which makes up the entire essence of the story .
 as a third outing , the island of dr . moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of `the planet of the apes' .
 the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .

lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient .
 great acting , music and cinematography were  or="1"&gt;nice ,
 but too many dull sub-plots and characters made the film hard to follow .
 ralph fiennes ( strange days , schindler's list ) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy , a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy .
 the story revolves around his past , in flashback form ,
 making it even more confusing .
 anyway , he is taken in by hana ( juliette binoche , the horseman on the roof ) , a boring war-torn nurse .
 she was never really made into anything ,
 until she met an indian towards the end ,
 developing yet another sub-plot .
 count almasy begins to remember
 what happened to him as
 it is explained by a stranger ( willem dafoe , basquiat ) .
 his love ( kirstin scott thomas , mission impossible ) was severely injured in a plane crash , and eventually died in a cave .
 he returned to find her dead and was heart-broken .
 so he flew her dead body somewhere , but was shot down from the ground .
 don't get the wrong idea , it may sound good and
 the trailer may be tempting ,
 but good is the last thing this film is .
 maybe if it were an hour less ,
 it may have been tolerable ,
 but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle .
 the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography .
 other than these , the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and wastes entirely too much film . ,

out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .
 though the plot description may at first seem like
 it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) ,
 after you watch it ,
 you realize that
 it's not nearly good enough .
 in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) ,
 a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .
 he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .
 he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise ,
 all he has is a name : terry valentine .
 valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .
 he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific &gt;ulee's gold in 1997 .
 seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson . 
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in 
just as valentine is having a big party .
 he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself ,
 who decides to run for it .
 what a mess .
 i have no problem when
 films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time
 -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece --
 but i do take exception to movies
 that decide to play around with it
 for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .
 the limey does exactly that .
 the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .
 therae is no method to this movie's madness .
 it uses a fancy way to tell a story
 that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .
 the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .
 this is a sort of brooding film --
 our protagonist doesn't speak much and
 the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude . 
i felt like
 the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself ,
 almost like he made this film for a paycheck .
 ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .
 sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .
 he's not much in the way of stature
 but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence
 that works to his advantage here .
 peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor :
 he's shy , quiet but always effective .
 he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression :
 his feelings don't always show on his face
 by you can always tell
 what they are .
 this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .
 why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story ,
 i don't know ,
 but what he does do certainly doesn't work .
 the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil --
 even the action scenes don't work .
 1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline ,
 but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .
 shall we go back to basics ?

a pseudo-intellectual film about the pseudo-intellectual world of art magazines ,
 high art is as wasted as its drug-addled protagonists .
 in the only notable part of the movie , ally sheedy and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles ,
 not that lisa cholodenko's script or direction makes you care much about either character .
 living in a world of heroin induced highs ,
 they float along until
 they fall in love with each other .
 this uninviting picture , full of pretentious minor characters , has a receptionist 
that reads dostoevski and a woman in the restroom line
 who is a certified genius , having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant .
 24-year-old syd ( radha mitchell ) , who has a rather bland , live-in boyfriend , was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine " frame . "
 although the receptionist is impressed ,
 syd is mainly a gofer for her boss 
until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner ( ally sheedy ) .
 for her to do photos for " frame , "
 lucy demands that
 syd be promoted to editor and assigned to her
 since lucy fancies her .
 lucy lives with her current lover , a washed up german actress named greta , 
played with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson .
 the two of them and their friends wile away their time snorting and shooting up dope , usually heroin . 
this does not happen in a single episode , but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture .
 syd , who lives in the apartment below them , joins in on the fun and becomes a member of the zombie club .
 lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs ,
 which apparently is funded by her mother .
 lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago
 since she thought
 she was being " pigeonholed , " and ,
 since her mother has money , 
we can only assume that
 that's how lucy supports her habit and procures her living expenses .
 a typical scene has the editors arguing about
 whether a potential photographer's work is transcendental or merely classical .
 that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious but not particularly funny . 
" your work has a cultural currency that is important now , " is the artist-speak that
 the frame's manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine .
 when the big scene comes in which
 lucy puts the moves on syd ,
 her idea of a romantic line is , " i want to get high with you . "
 in lucy's world , sex and drugs come hand-in-hand .
 and the movie , except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing , shows drug usage as being a hip and natural part of the art scene .
 this vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions .
 in another movie , it might have worked ,
 but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted .
 high art runs 1 : 36 .
 it is rated r for explicit sex , pervasive drug use and language and is not appropriate for those younger than college age .

" party camp , " is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies
 i've seen in awhile .
 a late rip-off of the " meatballs " series ,
 the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk .
 that's really about all 
that can be said about the " plot "
 because nothing much happens ,
 except that the main character , wise-cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) ,
 and there is a big contest in the climax .
 how fun !
 since , " party camp , " has practically no screenplay
 and there is no talent at all involved ,
 the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative .
 it's not that
 i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality ,
 but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this ,
 the least that could have been done would be
 to fill it with a lot of mindless sex .
 even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick .
 at least , then , it wouldn't have been such a chore to sit through .
 never before have i seen 
so many jokes fall astoundingly flat .
 the comedy was easy to spot ,
 but it wasn't the least bit funny .
 it was groan-inducing .
 constantly throghout , i was asking myself if
 director gary graver actually thought
 this movie was worth anything .
 so what saves , " party camp , " from the dreaded zero star rating ?
 well , that's simple :
 jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch .
 although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash ,
 at least if the film had centered on shepard ,
 she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low-budget teen comedy .

i'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters .
 in _the wedding singer_ , she was julia gulia .
 in _never been kissed_ , she's josie grossie .
 future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo-jo . . .
 aw forget it .
 i'll stick to my day job .
 this is a teen movie , all right ,
 except the main characters aren't teens .
 drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times
 who gets her big break as a reporter ,
 only it's very clear from the onset that
 she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness
 that marks the best of reporters .
 the story she's covering is not really a story , but a story in the making .
 she is to return to high school as a student and explain 
what's really going on .
 the irony is that 
drew's character , was such a dweeb first time around ,
 that she is terrified at going back .
 when she does ,
 she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the " i know the answer " in class
 that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject .
 at least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc's leelee sobieski--watch for her ) ,
 who turns out to be more beautiful than
 those who are " supposed " to be more beautiful than her .
 what works : drew's geeky old-self .
 after a start in films that was headline driven , and a nadir of roles
 that had her play the sluttish character ,
 it's a surprise to see her with bad hair , big glasses and braces .
 it's very funny .
 what doesn't work : drew's geeky new-self .
 come on .
 nobody dresses as bad as she does .
 couldn't she just go to _the gap_ and take suggestions ?
 had she dressed like princess leia
 it would have been better .
 the comedy is supposed to progress when
 drew's younger brother ( played with zest by david arquette ) reenlists to jump-start his baseball career .
 now , how in the world can somebody as nerdy ( but in a funny way ) as he can be the most popular kid in the school . . . in a day ? !
 the dialogue in the film is , well , an embarrassment .
 her co-workers ( molly shannon , john c . reilly and gary marshall ) are in terminal hyper-drive .
 her teenage peers ( except sobieski ) are so inept and stupid that
 there's little bite from them .
 couldn't the filmmakers watch _heathers_ first ?
 lastly , i am proud to say that
 i caught a significant gaffe in the film .
 if you see the film ,
 you'd know what i'm talking about :
 drew walks into a bar , has her hand stamped , and over the night associates with some rastafarians with some delicious , um , cake .
 she goes wild , sleeps in late .
 when she wakes ,
 she rushes off to school , without showering , without noticing that
 her head , lying on her stamped hand all night , has transferred part of the stamp's image to her forehead , spelling " loser " .
 funny , eh ? . . .
 except that the hand would have transferred that image backwords .

when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy ,
 i expect negative reviews from critics left and right .
 predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you's and the drive me crazy's released by the dozens these last couple of years . 
what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value
 while i'm sitting in the theater .
 am i enjoying myself ?
 is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ?
 this is why
 i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ;
 i had a party of a time wasting my money on 
something i won't remember next week .
 so last week i opened up the new york times -
 and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review .
 daily news ?
 negative .
 reelviews ?
 negative .
 epinions . com ?
 negative .
 this was nothing new .
 american pie , final destination , road trip didn't get such hot reviews 
and i loved those guilty pleasures .
 same goes for she's all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation 
that got unjustly pounded .
 since boys and girls reunites she's all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . ,
 i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again .
 but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people
 who had seen it ,
 the reactions were far from positive .
 i had made up my mind ;
 i'll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years .
 but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events
 ( we couldn't get into shaft because it is rated r ) ,
 i found myself watching boys and girls .
 whoops .
 boys and girls is about a " nerdy , smart " boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a " popular , flirt " girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) .
 briefly meeting as pre-teens and now attending the same college ,
 the two bump into each other so many times that
 eventually they become best friends .
 but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends
 without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other .
 with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) ,
 ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship .
 the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives -
 and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found .
 i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons .
 the dialogue is probably the worst
 i have ever seen in any movie ,
 mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is 
what hollywood thinks kids can relate to .
 it is almost offensive .
 an example of an insightful conversation : " you're dumb . dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . " " no . "
 ( followed by a mandy moore-esque tune background )
 ( well it's not as bad as wing commander
 i guess )
 the supporting cast is also painfully useless .
 detmer and biggs stand in the way 
for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots .
 and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex ,
 prinze jr's ryan dominates the screen while
 forlani's jennifer simply acts as a dilemma
 for him to work with .
 we never learn anything about jennifer
 which is a shame too because
 forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character .
 teenager or not :
 you'll hate this movie ,
 i guarantee it .
 maybe i should rent she's all that again .
 is it really as good as
 i think it is ?

all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity ,
 hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood .
 ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year .
 but , to paraphrase the bard , 
swill , by any other name , would smell as rank .
 no number of name changes can help this picture .
 it's not just about a disaster ,
 it is a disaster .
hard rain is the case of a movie
 that gets progressively worse with every passing minute .
 the best shot occurs during the opening credits ,
 as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana
 as the water level slowly rises .
 the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated 
as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies . 
from that moment on , it's all downhill .
 whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point .
 it takes forever to get to the end credits --
 this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures
 i have recently endured .
 basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs .
 there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions .
 it's all very routine and uninteresting because
 there aren't any real characters and 
the plot only occasionally makes sense .
 the film's conclusion is so preposterous that
 it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of
 seeing the monumentally idiotic way that
 the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots
 that are floating around .
 action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as
 they rush towards a conclusion .
 graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle .
 unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it .
 the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . 
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again .
 the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length .
 the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances .
 there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero
 who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash .
 he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's " lou grant " ) , get stuck on a street
 that's rapidly turning into a river .
 a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers .
 after charlie is killed in a shoot-out ,
 tom hides the money , then runs .
 as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads ,
 he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) ,
 whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives .
 there isn't any real acting in this film .
 christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera .
 tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters
 the actor has brought to the screen .
 randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing .
 morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances ,
 but they are defeated by the script .
 freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here 
, but i suppose 
everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time .
 following in the wake of twister , 
this is yet another natural disaster movie
 that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict .
 as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story
 that effectively ruins any potential 
that the flood tale could have had .
 titanic proved that
 there can be a wealth of drama in a movie
 where everything goes under water .
 hard rain successfully demonstrates that
 the opposite is equally possible .
 thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) .
 fortunately , there are only two elements left .

instinct is the kind of movie
 that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as " powerful " or " touching " .
 i have a name for it myself : " gross " .
 this is the sort of film where
 somebody stands up to a bully ,
 the bully looks at the " rebel " threateningly , about to hurt him ,
 and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too .
 how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me :
 aren't present day moviegoers beyond being " inspired " by something like that ? 
this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence .
 instinct's plot is brimming with potential :
 world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two year
 whilst doing research in the jungles of africa .
 he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ;
 he murdered to african policemen
 who were allegedly trying to capture him .
 after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport ,
 the authorities stick him in a prison's " psychotics ward " .
 assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) .
 caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career .
 of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and
 he becomes fixed on helping powell prove
 that he is not a psychotic and that
 he should not be in prison .
 and then there's the inevitable " heartless meanie " character , in the form of donald sutherland
 who plays caulder's mentor .
 he cares for caulder 
but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell .
let's get one thing straight :
 dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist
 i have ever seen , on screen or off .
 any good shrink will listen to
 what his patient has to say no matter the subject because 
any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way .
 not good old theo .
 no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and
 when powell dares to venture to another subject
 caulder says " we need to talk about this right now . "
this is a flaw only in the sense that
 it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ;
 unfortunately it's also the least of its problems .
 director jon turteltaub ,
 who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that ,
 contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe ,
 it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs .
 it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes 
( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that )
 but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus 
( excuse the graphic depiction ) .
 it aims to " inspire " rather than to touch hearts .
 as yoda would say ,
 inspire it does not .
 it is the ultimate sign of futility when 
a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story .
 indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct ,
 one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character .
 this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence .
 i am forced to wonder whether
 turteltaub and di pego did not think that
 we could figure out 
what instinct is about simply from regular conversation .
 i think that
 anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors ,
 and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever .
 oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful .
 his performance is at least part of what
 makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink .
 i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets
 but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling .
 i love animals ,
 and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly
 something i could sympathize with .
 however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable .
 tone down the violence and
 this will be a chick flick .

sydney lumet is the director
 whose work happens to be of varied quality .
 he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades , like twelve angry men , serpico or the verdict 
 but , in the same time , almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers 
that hamper lumet's reputation .
 a stranger among us , 1992 rip-off of peter weir's witness , belongs to the latter category .
 the heroine of this movie is emily eden ( melanie griffith ) , tough lady cop
 who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york .
 during one of such actions , her partner nick ( jamey sheridan ) got hurt and as a result ,
 she becomes depressed .
 in order to help her recover ,
 bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller
 who belonged to hassidic jew community .
 emily starts investigation and soon realises that
 the case involves murder .
 concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community ,
 she decides to go undercover .
 that isn't easy ,
 because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways .
 things get even more complicated when 
she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel ( eric thal ) .
 using peter weir's formula isn't the greatest flaw of this film .
 even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent .
 but the worst insult to viewer's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith .
 the author of this review never liked this actress very much ,
 but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles .
 role of emily eden , unfortunately , isn't one of them .
 first of all , she can't pass for tough nypd street fighter ,
 and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman isn't much better .
 screenplay by robert j . avrech makes things even worse with some formulaic red herring subplots 
( scene involving two italian gangsters was almost too painful to watch ) .
 but , on the other hand , other actors are more convincing ( lee richardson as an old rabbi , thal as ariel and charming mia sara as his intended bride ) ,
 and the photography by andrzej bartkowiak very effectively creates atmosphere of warmth
 when the scenes take place in hassidic community .
 also , the film might educate viewers about hassidic culture .
 that is the only thing that prevents it from turning into total waste of time .

" the world on land -- it's just too big for me . "
 starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii .
 rated r .
 the legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage
 that goes nowhere fast .
 it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . . 1900 .
you heard right .
 his name is , in all actuality , 1900 .
 he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman .
 1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny's fear that
 he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . "
 well , when 1900 is about 9 or so ,
 he starts wondering all around the ship .
 one day , he discovers a grand piano .
 he sits down and starts playing .
 miraculously , what comes out is beautiful .
 a group of onlookers gathers to watch 
this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age .
 when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that
 his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations "
 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! "
 ho ho ho .
 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .
 when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business ,
 onboard comes another musician . 
his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and
 he plays the trumpet .
 after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm ,
 he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays
 while the piano flies all around the hall ,
 taking them with it .
 how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate ,
 i don't know ,
 but this apparently isn't the kind of thing 
we're supposed to ask .
 after that , 1900 and max become friends .
 max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover
 what he is missing on land ,
 but 1900 has no intention of doing so .
 what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him :
 when a record company hears about his talents ,
 they come on board to make a record of his music ,
 but after finding out that -- gasp ! -- they're going to make millions of copies ,
 he breaks the record .
 the conflict of the movie is that
 after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself ,
 he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store .
 the record shouldn't exist because 
a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and 
b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .
 ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery !
 the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .
 we're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . . piano duel ?
 there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel .
 1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man :
 i can't recall a single word he said 
that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .
 ditto for max ,
 who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .
 tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ;
 there's no spirit , no gusto to the character .
 he insists that
 he leads a happy life on the ship ,
 but to us he is dead .
 pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit . 
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz "
 who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .
 the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore ,
 whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .
 this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .
 at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie
 that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .

my giant is two movies for the price of one ,
 but neither is worth the cost of admission ,
 even if you get in free .
 as lamely directed by michael lehmann ,
 the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .
 ( " without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . " )
 languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious
 as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .
 since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic ,
 what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .
 other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture .
 with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers ,
billy crystal has shown that
 he's more than the world's best oscar host .
 he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant .
 one wonders if
 he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .
 surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that
 there was nothing there .
 perhaps he thought 
he could ad lib it into success .
 or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought
 he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone .
 the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that
 it is so ineffectual that
 people will probably forget
 they saw it by the next day .
 this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .
 sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .
 after throwing out constant one-liners ( " either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . " ) ,
 sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket .
 and although he doesn't like it ,
 he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs .
 ( the movie itself knows no bounds as
 it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )
 after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over ,
 and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .
 we learn that
 max's condition is terminal ,
 and he will soon die .
 to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes -
 all of which you can see in the trailers .
 let's hope
 billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before
 he signs up for another movie .
 my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .
 it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .
 my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .
 matthew pointed out that it " is not as good as it could have been or should have been . "
 ( amen . )
 he went on to comment that
 he did not like the way 
the movie changed completely in the middle .

talk about a movie
 that seemed dated
 before it even hit the theaters !
 spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .
 it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch .
 when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which
 identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .
 the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .
 there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far
 you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat .
 the film itself doesn't really have a plot .
it follows the girls as
 they travel here and there , culminating at their " first live performance " at albert hall .
 the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .
 the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff . 
whew .
 for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .
 from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .
 heck , even roger moore shows up ,
 though he can't decide if
 he's parodying himself as james bond , or if
 he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .
 richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford .
 the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time
 when confronted with the rest of the film .
 neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs
 they are deadly boring .
 their songs are alright ,
 but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .
 my advice to fans is :
stay home and watch that video collection ,
 or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . .
 either option will be more enjoyable than the film .
 non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .

this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one .
 not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts ,
 but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure .
 an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance .
 the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience .
 this is a story
 that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching .
 summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) ,
 a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country .
 ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy .
 he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous .
 he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy .
 he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment .
 so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball .
 then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods 
whose lawn he manicures .
 tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan .
 if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , 
then you need a remedial course in film viewing . 
as always prinze is pretty to look at ,
 but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination .
 biel cries a lot ,
 while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father .
 the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher .
 summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural .
 no curve balls here , no sliders . 
every pitch is predictable .
 a blind umpire could call this movie .
 summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking .
 it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame 
as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn .

one of the responses those that enjoy " detroit rock city " ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : " oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us . just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? "
 i'm wondering the same thing .
 i feel like
 i should have had a grand time with " detroit rock city . "
 it's the sort of movie
 i wish i could've had a lot of fun with ,
 but i didn't .
 i just didn't .
 surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards ,
 so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ?
 no , but i expected something .
 a funny joke .
 a clever prank .
 a plot development .
 anything .
 the movie never delivers .
 you've got to marvel at how
 the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie
 that is truly about nothing .
 " detroit rock city " is one of those films
 that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that 
you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which
 absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence ,
 and it's not a very satisfying realization .
 the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan .
 that's it .
 there is no big plot description in this review ,
 because the movie has very little plot .
 the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) .
 they have a garage band .
 they're pathetic , like all garage bands ,
 but they like kiss and
 they like rock n' roll ,
 so i guess that means
 we root for them .
 they have tickets ,
 they lose them .
 they get more tickets ,
 they lose those too .
 they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets ,
 most of which backfire .
 there's not much more to it .
 frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see
 them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film ,
 when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands ,
 only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity .
 oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother
 who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency .
 she doesn't want them to see kiss ,
 if you hadn't figured that out already .
 it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this .
 we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy .
 then again , " maximum overdrive " had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .
 " detroit rock city " doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude ,
 but it gets dangerously close .
 in fact , the music is the only thing 
that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind .
 basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star ,
 which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson ,
 whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's " highway to hell " sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) .
 it's also really sad to see
 the talents of the cast go to waste ,
 because it' s evident that
 they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie .
 edward furlong has done far better work than this ,
 and so has natasha lyonne ,
 and so has lin shaye ,
 but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood .
 people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed ,
 considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song .
 too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .
 director adam rifkin knows
 he hasn't got much material to work with ,
 so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning . 
we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras ,
 all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script .
 it's fun for a while ,
 but eventually it becomes disorienting .
 i would recommend that
 those who felt seasick at " the blair witch project " stay far away from " detroit rock city , "
 because the witch has got nothing on this baby . 
i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since " armageddon . "
 and what about that script ?
 it's written by carl j . dupr ? ,
 which sounds like as made-up a name as
 i've ever heard .
 if it is ,
 i can't say 
i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .
 a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun ,
 if the jokes and gags are actually funny .
 the jokes in " detroit rock city " rarely are .
 in fact , the only time i really laughed was when
 a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza ,
 and that was just because
 it was so surreal .
 the rest of the movie just seems like
 they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it " comedy . "
 there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines
 that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles ,
 precisely because there was no set-up .
 it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , " see ? funny ! "
 look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that
 she spilled her drink .
 see ?
 funny !
 look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .
 twice .
 see ?
 funny !
 look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .
 see ?
 funny !
 a word of advice to mr . dupr ? :
 no , these things aren't funny all by themselves .
  they must be preceded by a clever set-up so
 the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance . 
that's it ,
 i,'ve said enough about this movie .
 it's a waste of time and money .
 i liked the music ,
 but don't bother buying the soundtrack .
 i hear
 it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs
 that are actually in the movie .
 you want to see this concept executed well ?
 go rent roger corman's 1979 classic " rock n' roll high school . "
 it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story 
about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .
 yes , go rent that , and skip " detroit rock city , "
 which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

has it really been two decades since
 walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?
 nineteen years and two mighty ducks later , the formula is still going strong .
 police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small-town deputy sheriff corralled into co-coaching the school's hastily formed soccer team .
 his partner-in-crime is the new british " exchange teacher " ( olivia d'abo ) , a lively lass
 who has obviously seen dangerous minds and knows that
 the best way to gain the respect of a disinterested , outer-city audience is to teach them something neat .
 like soccer .
 most of the good-natured gags are of the fast-motion variety , such as runaway cows and out-of-control lawnmowers .
 kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit ,
 while their parents peacefully doze beside them .
 other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed ,
 what's missing from the big green is a better integration of music and comedy .
 instead of a peppy pop score ,
 which would arguably work to better effect ,
 most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score
 that belongs somewhere else .
 comedy needs music .
 just watch any old bugs bunny short .
 the marx brothers knew it .
 mel brooks knows it . 
unfortunately , the current trend is to " overscore . "
 lush strings and booming brass in every scene , at every moment .
 remember the simple strains of bizet's " habanera " in the original bad news bears ?
 these days , it's usually a bellowing fanfare 
that threatens to smother every scene in its path .
 much like adding frosting to already frosted cake .

funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways .
 the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature .
 what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material --
an inadvertently hilarious story
 that made me scream advice at the characters . "
 get new jobs ! " was one line , if i remember correctly .
 at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer
 who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda .
 he is having immensely stereotypical problems :
the natives are restless ,
 his boss is a jerk ,
 and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off .
 patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) .
 the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions ,
 they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy .
 they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it ,
 and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs
 to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature .
 give me a break .
 the movie hasn't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ;
 it's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us .
 even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic .
 get this :
 remington's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up .
 he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . 
by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open
 from me pounding my forehead with my hand . 
the acting is forgettable .
 douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow ,
 but it's nothing
 he hasn't done before .
 kilmer looks like 
he wishes
 he were someone else , somewhere else ,
 and the rest vanish into the cinematography .
 the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that
 most of the lion attacks are incoherent .
 what did i expect from this movie ?
 i dunno .
 some real excitement , i suppose .
 a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation . 
no such luck .
 i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway's " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind .

unfortunately it doesn't get much more formulaic than one tough cop .
 there's the renegade cop with the loser partner
 who has to many problems to explain .
 the renegade has to prove his good name and is trapped between the good guys , the bad guys and some woman
 who really has nothing to do with the story other than being there for the purpose of providing sex for the hero in the middle of the film .
 bo dietl ( pronounced deedle , baldwin ) is one tough cop , a guy
 who is being investigated by hardass fbi agents due to his association with the ny mafia .
 on top of that problem , he has a drunk , gambling addicted partner ( penn )
 who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets 
( i guess cops aren't immune ? ) .
 then , throw into the mix the femme fatale ( gershon ) .
 right there you have plenty of ammo for a decent cop drama .
 but right in the middle of the film ,
 they throw in a completely un-related plot point .
 dietl and his partner duke try to solve a case
 that they have been warned to stay away from . 
the film spends over half an hour tracking the case of a nun 
who was beaten and raped to near death .
 once the case is solved ,
 the film shifts focus back to the mafia issue .
 whatever neat meshthe screenwriter wanted to create between the two stories failed miserably .
 aside from being asked to accept michael mcglone as a mafioso 
( an insult if you ask me )
 the performances were pretty good .
 baldwin , though he occasionally slips into an impression of his brother alec , does a fine job as one tough cop .
 penn , who also slips into an impression of his brother sean , is even better as a loser tough guy cop .
 what one tough cop lacks is originality .
 this film offers nothing new .
 nothing that you can't get from any cop film .
 it screams sidney lumet all over the place ,
 perhaps because it was produced by marty and michael bregman , producers of lumet's dog day afternoon and serpico .
 but even the masterful sidney would not have been able to make one tough cop into a good film .
 too much else is lacking .
 i also saw the boom mic pop into the top of the frame twice early on in the picture ,
 something that i almost never notice .
 but once i saw that ,
 i had it in the back of my mind every time
 i saw a medium or long shot .
 at times , i was hoping to see it .
 one tough cop isn't laughable ,
 nor is it a terrible film ,
 but it just isn't unique .
 it is a classic example of a film 
that didn't need to be made .
 but one thing is for sure ,
 it could really use a better title .

supposedly based on a true story in which
 the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after
 a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 .
 john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails .
 a world renound hunter , remington ( &gt;michael douglas ) , is called in and
 the battle , man against lion , begins .
 this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery .
 the acting is not too bad except
 the characters are all so thin .
 we only see one side of each character .
 kilmer is a bridge builder
 and that's all we see him as .
 these lions kill dozens of his men and
 he doesn't even appear to be too upset about it .
 and the plot ?
 it's jaws , but with lions .
 again we're presented with an animal
 that behaves not at all as it should .
 it appears to kill men
 because it just likes too .
 why ?
 who knows .
 i guess there wouldn't be much of a story
 if it didn't .
 the problem is that
 there isn't much of a story
 even though it does .

of course i knew this going in .
 why is it that
 whenever a tv-star makes a movie
 it's always a romantic comedy ,
 and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that
 they were " attracted to the characters . they were really original . " 
original ? !
 let me give you a run-through of picture perfect :
 character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things
 she can't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .
 her boss will only give her the job if
 she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar ,
 and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .
 what does she do ?
 she invents a fiance !
 then when everyone wants to meet him ,
 she tells some poor schmoe
 she met at a wedding that
 she will pay him $1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job ,
 since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and
 she is the poor , defenceless female .
 he , of course , goes along with it .
 gee , i wonder if 
they get together in the end .
 i've seen more original stuff on the wb .
 and better stuff too .
 picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes ,
 and expecting us to like aniston's character ,
 who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .

louie is a trumpeter swan with no voice .
 in order to woo his lady love serina ,
 louie makes friends with a young boy , sammy ,
 who persuades teacher mrs . hammerbottom ( carol burnett ) to allow louie to attend class .
 louie learns to read and write and returns to his flock , but is laughed at once again when
 no other swans can understand his message of love for serina .
 to make matters worse , louie's father feels
 he's lost his honor 
because of the trumpet he stole for his son in this animated version of e . b . white's " trumpet of the swan . "
 as jane austen and henry james have become popular sources for adult filmmakers over the past decade or so ,
 e . b . white is being returned to for children's films .
 the animated " charlotte's web " has become a minor classic since its release in 1973 
and 1999 brought us a live action version of " stuart little . "
 " trumpet of the swan , " directed by richard rich ( 1999's animated " the king and i , " the " swan princess " series ) , is unlikely to be remembered along with those two .
 " trumpet of the swan " is receiving a regional theatrical release , but is sure to quickly appear on home video .
 boston is one of the targetted cities because
 our hero louie becomes famous playing his trumpet in beantown .
 he encounters a gypsy-like con man in the public gardens
 who pitches louie and his trumpet as an added attraction to boston's swan boats .
 louie stays at the ritz carlton before giving a concert at the hatch shell along the banks of the charles river .
 at this point , louie's earned enough money so that
 dad can pay for the trumpet and become musically capable enough to win over serina's father .
 " trumpet of the swan " features flat background art , some poor sound syncing and insipid , sugary songs .
 this effort would be better suited to saturday morning television than the big screen ,
 but may be ok for the real small set .

one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles .
 he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish ,
 and one of his best was his last film , lone star .
 after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border ,
 expectation ran high for his next film .
 unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for .
 we are essentially told in the first reel
 where the film is going to go and
 what it is going to do .
 then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is .
 the plot of men with guns can be summarized "
 in a central or south american country 
things are really bad for everybody in the mountains
 where the army clashes with the guerrillas .
 dr . fuentes did not believe
 how bad things were
 so he went .
 and he found out again and again and again . "
 of course it is perfectly true that
 in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .
 a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .
 but the film talks down to the viewer .
 dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .
 he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .
 fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .
 then he discovers 
one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .
 in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student
 what has happened to the others .
 the student tells him 
the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that
 it may not be a good place to be .
 fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient
 who happens to be an army general .
 the results are little different than
 one would expect .
 dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .
 even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that
 things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .
 but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover
 how wrong he was .
 sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that
 nasty things are happening down there and
 most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .
 the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .
 federico luppi is the good mexican actor
 who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .

'traffic violation' dr . daniel's review of u-turn
 dr . d's rating : critical condition
 ( okay , here's the deal .
 i'll be the first one to grant that 
everybody needs a day off now and then .
 i'll even go so far as to say that
 a vacation is a necessary part of doing any job well .
 i mean , hey ,
 i've been known to stretch a weekend into a three-day outing ,
 if friday looks to be a slow day .
 and if monday ain't looking like a pick-me-up , well ,
 i've been known to give martha nell a call and say , " do me a favor , sweetheart . bump old man ferguson's boil lancing to tuesday morning , and tell miss audrey that i'll swing by her house monday evening and see if we can't get her trick knee back in line . "
 a simple sentence like that , and i've got a nice four-day fishing trip with the boys , or more often than not , a trip up to cherokee , n . c . , for jackpot bingo and assorted other mountain funnery .
 but the point is , if you take a day off ,
 do something different .
 if you've worked yourself silly for months ,
 relax a bit .
 sleep in .
 eat pancakes at noon .
 microwave an egg in its shell .
 watch pro wrestling with the sound off .
 listen to some barry white records at high speed .
 whatever .
 but do not , under any circumstances , spend your vacation doing the same thing
 you do for a living .
 and , if you do ,
 don't make the final product look ten times worse than 
it would any other time .
 because i do not want to hear your sob stories , oliver stone .
 you apparently thought
 you needed a break from making " important films . "
 cool .
 so you found this hinky little book and decided to make it a movie .
 that's cool , too .
 but , ollie , old sage , do not take a good story and a hot cast and make one of the most pointless and worthless films of the decade .
 i'm just eager to meet you one day ,
 so i can buy you a stoli , look you in the eye and say ,
 " what in the wide world of sports were you thinking with u-turn ? "
 and i'll stand there
 staring 'til i get a straight answer .
 sean penn stars u-turn , as bobby , a drifter
 who's had some troubles a while back . 
he's heading cross the desert minus two fingers when
 his mustang ragtop blows a radiator hose , stranding him in superior , arizona , held there by an " ignorant , inbred , turtleneck hick " of a mechanic named darrell .
 while darrell puts a new hose on the ride ,
 bobby walks into town to see 
what's cooking .
 is it needless of me to say that
 superior , arizona , is not exactly the shiny scrubbed home of all things lovely ?
 probably not .
 bobby meets up with grace ( jennifer lopez ) ,
 who invites him back to her place , for drape-hanging and other domestic issues .
 just as those issues are starting up ,
 grace's husband , jake , storms in , looking like check-out day of the elks lodge convention .
 just beats bobby silly .
 bobby takes to the road , only to meet up with jake again ,
 and jake asks bobby to kill grace .
 a little while later , grace asks bobby to kill jake .
 them murderous arizonians .
 gotta love 'em .
 if any of this sounds familiar , congratulations .
 you win a kewpie doll .
 the story is a straight shoplift of red rock west , a cult favorite a few years back from john dahl , maker of the phenomenal the last seduction .
 but the contest doesn't end there , guys and gals .
 we get steals from russ meyer movies ,
 where everybody in town is horny and sweaty .
 we get the town from bad day at black rock , minus the train , plus busty women 
who can speak .
 look at any schwarzenegger film ,
 and you'll see our hero , bobby ,
 as bobby has a mudhole stomped in his keister a dozen times , has his ribs stove in at least fifteen times , gets bit by a tarantula , gets shot at , and ends up with vultures circling overhead , all the while getting up like
 he just got a shaving nick .
 bobby as terminator ?
 stretch it a bit ,
 and we have a five-finger discount from doc hollywood ,
 where the whole story occurs because of car trouble ,
 forcing the main character to stay at the mercy of the town and the mechanic . 
okay , he's working from a book ,
 so maybe ollie's not totally to blame for blatantly copping these ideas .
 i just expect a man
 who can make up an alternative history of the united states to be able to craft a few original ideas before exposing the negative .
 i just wish
 he hadn't brought a cast like this together for what amounts to a group toe-stub .
 sean penn gives a great performance ,
 and jennifer lopez and nick nolte are as on target as
 they can be , playing over-the-top caricatures of stereotype characters .
 the best thing about the movie is watching penn react to the madness around him and try to figure out exactly 
what the blankety-blank is going on .
 too bad it's not fun to watch when
 it's happening to us . . .
 while we sit through this mess of a film .
 u-turn is not a bad film
 if you're a fan of technique .
 it's the oliver stone
 you've always known .
 robert richardson is his usual cinematographer ,
 and rob and ollie know how to shoot a flick -- great camera angles , shifting viewpoints , wicked colors , nice looking pictures .
 but pictures of what ?
 i think i'd rather stare at a xeroxed envelope for two hours than try to figure out the tilt-o-whirl point of this loser film .
 plot twists are one thing ,
 repetition is almost unforgivable ,
 and this is dang near as unforgivable as
 any movie i've seen in the past five years .
 oliver , i know your body of work is nothing to sniff at .
 you've been nice enough to limit us to only one doors movie ,
 and films like platoon , jfk , wall street and nixon give us plenty to dig on .
 your scripts are certainly respectable ,
 your budgets are up there on the screen ,
 and your actors don't dog it .
 and i know that , maybe ,
 with u-turn , you were just kicking back , just having fun .
 that's fine .
 but don't do that with a movie with the potential of this one .
 do some police academy sequel
 ( imagine that . ) 
do a big comedy , like a remake of it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world .
 but do not drop a limp u-turn out of your pocket and expect us to accept it as " an oliver stone movie , " and not question why
 it stinks like week-old snook .
 there's a right way to have fun , and a wrong way to have fun .
 this was as wrong as you can get without going to jail .

there are two things 
the american film industry should avoid at all costs .
 one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film .
 two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta .
 to wit , we present the disaster
 that is battlefield earth .
 a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild ,
 battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons
 when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior .
 sci-fi is always a tricky beast :
 tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs .
 battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes .
 here's the `plot . '
 the year is 3000 .
 mankind has been become an endangered species 
thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos
 ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) .
 a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons'
 who dwell in the cities below .
 the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and
 terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver .
 a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . '
 he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base .
 after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end .
 jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine
 terel forces him to use .
 then the story just runs along until
 jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet .
 the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle
 that had me praying for the end credits .
 roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . . and decided to steal every scene
 he could for battlefield earth .
 christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie !
 and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really .
 the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit .
 travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect .
 jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! '
 then there's the script :
 the film just never convinces you that
 the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve .
 why ?
 because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason
 beside the fact that
 `humans are stupid . '
 terel may be right , you know .
 humans made this movie .

would you believe --
 in real life , i mean -- 
that if you were julia roberts , that
 you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ?
 let me tell you
 what reality is .
 reality is that 
you are megastar julia fricking roberts 
and your brother is eric roberts ,
 and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as
 you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot .
 that's reality .
 america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck
 that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran ,
 presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) .
 the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time .
 the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation ,
 and the press and public have not been forgiving 
( think meg and dennis ) .
 gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage .
 veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting
 they haven't seen the movie at all .
 ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks
 this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . )
 and did i mention
 gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ?
 and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ?
 oh billy , you're a scamp !
 the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ? and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure ,
 but it's not a funny one .
 yes , crystal tells us ,
 hollywood is lying to our faces !
 if you are surprised by this ,
 you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine .
 it's about to expire .
 aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) ,
 america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , 
its pace is choppy ,
 and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project 
-- not for headlining star julia roberts --
 but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines
 that he wrote himself .
 i didn't time it
 ( the movie's not that bad ) ,
 but it's crystal
 who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film .
 bad move , billy --
 your jokes suck .
 the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags --
 and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene ,
 how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me .
 julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film ,
 but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here .
 obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise .
 none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ;
 azaria comes off as a preening queen 
when he's supposed to be macho .
 as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution ,
 which produced this work .
 he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years .
 it'll probably be another 11 before 
he's back again .
 i could drone on about how
 america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons
 who talk on their cell phones during the movies ,
 but that would get old .
 instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin :
 that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment .
 every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful ,
 and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains .
 when you leave the theater ,
 you'll ask yourself , too :
 why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ?

rated : r for strong violence , language , drug use , nudity , and some sexuality .
 starring : wesley snipes , anne archer , michael chaykin , donald sutherland , marie matiko .
 running time : 117 minutes
 directed by : christian duguay
 i've never fully understood wesley snipes's career .
 he has his ups and downs , but mostly the downs .
 his best movie was one of the best of 1998 
and that movie was entitled " blade " .
 he has had his typical action movies , " boiling point " , " passenger 57 " ,
 but his new movie " the art of war " should just be called " rising sun 2 : the art of war "
 cause basically it's a semi-remake of the same plot , with a different cast , and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller ,
 that is high on style and low on substance .
 wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u . n .
 after a chinese ambassador is killed ,
 he is on the track of the killer , trying to find out
 who it is ,
 how it happened ,
 where the killer was ,
 and what to do .
 anne archer plays his " boss " type person of the u . n . and
 she has hired snipes to track down the killer .
 well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer , and is now an outlaw , kidnapping a chinese woman with him , and having her help him along the way .
 all this leads to a finale
 that is so dumb , and so stupid that
 is it unbelievably dumb ,
 and the stunts , dialogue and acting all ruin this movie .
 wesley snipes isn't one of my favorite actors because of the fact that
 the character he plays in every movie is the same character
 he plays in the movie before .
 the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998's " blade " .
 i walked into " the art of war " expecting a good , high octane thriller ,
 and all i got was a pile of mush .
 the only real 'good' thing the movie has is action , and plenty of it ,
 but i noticed
 it is badly filmed ,
 the camera is so shaky
 you cannot even tell
 what is going on .
 the ending finale is so worthless and pitiful ,
 that it even tries to mock " the matrix " ,
 laughably funny , it is undeniably stupid .
 christian duguay's direction is also not that great .
 his camera angles and sense of style are all in place ,
 but sadly his lighting and editing are all badly done .
 even the whole " matrix " ending wasn't even good .
 the stunts and action are badly filmed , and badly choreographed .
 his placing of the characters , and the assination of the chinese ambassado , and the plotting of the movie are so predictable and laughable ,
 that it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie .
 anne archer who is usually good in her roles , turns in a horrible job here .
 she is sour , downbeat , and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue , and dumb moves .
 even donald sutherland as a co-star can't save this movie from being a bust .
 so for an overall opinion : " the art of war " is a total waste of time .
 it's not entertaining , nor exciting , or even action packed .
 it is a pointless movie , and makes absolutely no sense at all .
 if you really want to see a good version of " the art of war " , rent the wesley snipes and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind " rising sun " ,
 it isn't a great film either ,
 but at least it's better than this .

movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable .
 i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in '95 ,
 but i wanted to re-write it
 because not all retro reviews should be about the classics .
 we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too .
 this picture was so bad ,
 it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating 
( see ratings chart below ) .
 the only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that
 being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno .
 so , it does indeed have some plusses . . .
 in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff .
 and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .
 this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) far too annoying far too often .
 like in 1998s " bulworth " ,
 when the movie was over
 i didn't care one little iota about the main character .
 at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though .
 " showgirls " is too stupid to make a statement .
 some people claim that
 the story is based on the legendary " all about eve " of all things !
 if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter 
that joseph l . mankiewicz was ,
 he'd be . . . well ,
 he'd be a good screenwriter .
 instead , this project may have sunk his career .
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) script and
 the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed .
 the same team who created a good sex-film in 1992 ( " basic instinct " ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x-rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones .
 the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer .
 after the supposed street-smart young " lady " gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack-jawed yokel in the opening sequence ,
 she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the " stardust hotel " .
 nomi doesn't take advantage of this contact to break into the big-time of dirty dancing right away .
 first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club .
 she sells her hot little wares at " the cheetah " for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience .
 hey , i never said 
she wasn't a hot number . . .
 maybe it's that ,her body ,
 which gets her into the big-time when
 the star of the " stardust hotel " , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club 
( it certainly isn't her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) .
 crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) .
 he also happens to be the pleasure-seeking worm
 who runs the big show .
 crystal gets nomi onto the " stardust " team and ,
 after an interminable amount of time , nomi " earns " the role of crystal's understudy .
 the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal .
 it was almost laughable that
 nomi had the guts to claim that 
she's " not a whore " .
 that's a phrase we hear a few different times 
and it's completely ludicrous .
 of course she is !
 she sells her soul to make it big ,
 but in the end we're supposed to believe that
 she's a better person than that .
 we're supposed to root for her .
 no way !
 she's a tramp and a back-stabber 
who deserved nothing--least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax .
 she is not a good person and
 they take over two hours to explain that 
the audience should think that
 she is .
 the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more .
 it sure ain't character development !
 plummer also appeared in " speed " in '94 in a smaller , yet better role .
 this sub-plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that
 fornicators should practice birth control .
 kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay-day or
 his standards have dipped since appearing in " blue velvet " .
 that picture was weird , 
but some critics claim 
it's one of the best movies of the '80s .
 now ol' kyle can say that
 he acted in one of the worst of the '90s , too .
 his sleazy character is important to " showgirls " ,
 but we don't learn anything about him .
 he uses people
 to get what he wants ,
 but that only means that
 he fits in well with the other characters in this movie .
 is he a villain ?
 who cares !
 ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as
 it is explicit .
 everyone must know by now about the soft-core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool .
 what few reviewers take issue with is 
how mean-spirited this movie is .
 everyone's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing
 they were having sex or exacting revenge .
 it's just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) .
 if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world ,
 why couldn't verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ?
 it's hard to care about these people if
 we can't even appreciate what
 they're capable of doing on-stage .
 berkley may have a future in hollywood because
 she can dance and
 she has a great body .
 after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession .
 perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford .
 oops , they're bad actors , too .
 well , at least , they're not selfish and contemptable like good ol' slutty nomi malone .
 useless trivia--ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and " holier than thou " jessie on the teeny-bopper tv show , " saved by the bell " , before breaking onto the big screen .

mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film ,
 so you should know what to expect .
 a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences
 that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .
 however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts ,
 and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .
 jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .
 this time out , he's a famous chef 
who hosts an australian cooking show .
 not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .
 there are only two scenes of him cooking .
 for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .
 it never does explain why
 his character has such superb martial arts skills . . .
 perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?
 a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .
 although she only has one camcorder ,
 somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . .
 hmmm , shades of broadcast news ? ? ?
 anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape .
 here lies another crucial flaw in the story :
 doesn't anyone realize
 you can copy a tape ?
 oh well , no one ever said
 jackie chan movies had to make sense .
 as luck would have it ,
 diana runs across jackie 
, and , wouldn't you know it ,
 jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .
 this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes
which look like 
they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .
 in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences ,
 the film uses english as its primary language .
 however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing
 that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases .
 strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .
 whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia ,
 it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films .
 the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .
 but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films ,
 it seems odd that
 the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .
 look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef ,
 why not use that to your advantage ?
 watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .
 the action is a mixed bag here .
 there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes
 that have become the trademark of jackie's films . 
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that
 there are lots of nifty things lying around
 that can be useful ala jackie chan .
 the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst ,
 but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .
 the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .
 once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .
 but to slo-mo jackie running ?
 either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that
 jackie may be slowing down . 
if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix ,
 go ahead and see mr . nice guy .
 however , if you're just in the mood for some good action ,
 you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

" first rule of fight club is , don't talk about fight club . "
 this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film ,
 because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning .
 director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge .
 with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised
 i didn't walk out .
 this just goes to show that
 hype kills .
 it's very rare that
 a film so hyped up as " fight club " turns out to be noteworthy ,
 and this is no exception .
 the story goes like this .
 edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions ,
 until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .
 norton claims that
 she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle ,
 when he spots her at a session 
that he also attended .
 apparently the disease sessions help them see what
 life is like , literally living in pain .
 why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me ,
 but things do get worse .
 norton is soon assigned to a job
 that calls for traveling , 
and it's on a plane that
 he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .
 the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and
 by golly after they get drunk ,
 the two pitiful characters fight .
 how do they come up with this stuff ?
 anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention ,
 and a club is formed .
 out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .
 fincher shows us that
 society is like robots .
 we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .
 our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse 
than they really are ,
 and we blame it on others .
 call me crazy ,
 but this is common knowledge .
 i think
 fincher was acting as if 
the film is moodier and more poignant than
 it really is ,
 which is probably one of the reasons
 it fails miserably .
 even with two good actors , and a solid actress ,
 they only manage to weaken the story .
 i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when
 norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .
 it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .
 i guess
 brad pitt was right for this role ,
 because i felt like beating him up myself .
 his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .
 it only showed me that
 he was in it for the money and nothing more .
 helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .
 she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .
 this continues for
 what seems like 6 hours .
 the film drags on and
 my headache gets bigger ,
 while " fight club " nears what i think might be the end .
 unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .
 though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes ,
 it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .
 on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film ,
 that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time
 that they did on the trailer .
 fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .
 concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good
 if everything else is in need of support .
 also , i'm afraid that 
immature men might respond to the film's violence .
 the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult . 
when the film ends ,
 i'm just glad to get home and take some advil .
 you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton 
when he says
 " this is so f * * * ing stupid . "

note to screenwriters and self :
 when you hit the big time ,
 and the studios come knocking for those scripts
 that are sitting in your bottom drawer ,
 tell ? em all to hit the road .
 gilligan wrote the arbitrarily-titled home fries ten years ago ;
 it was shelved until
 he found success as one of " the took a second look at gilligan's " comedy " -
 they read it again wearing rose-tinted glasses .
 drew stars as sally , a dim ( but sweet ) , pregnant waitress at a small town burger joint located somewhere in the southern united states .
 the father of her child is dead , the victim of a severe heart attack brought on by sadistic torture from his two stepsons -
 these flyboys scared him with their low-flying helicopter .
 dorian ( wilson ) and angus ( busey ) were getting even for his philandering ways on behalf of their anguished mother ( o'hara ) .
 trouble is ,
 sally picked up some interference on her drive-thru headset ,
 and angus worries
 she may have heard conversations
 that took place in the helicopter prior to the accidental killing .
 so dorian goes undercover as a burger-flipper ;
 before you can say " with cheese "
he falls for the mother-to-be .
 too bad mom and angus have homicidal plans for sally .
 does this sound like a movie you want to see ?
 without a doubt , the best thing about home fries is barrymore ;
 at the risk of sounding sexist , she's never looked better than here , as a curly redhead with twinkling eyes .
 she is winning in a role
 that requires her to do absolutely nothing except look apple-cheek cute and gawk at wilson , her real-life boyfriend .
 but the plot and the situations are so off-putting that
 nothing could save it .
 this movie desperately wants to get mentioned in the same breath as the coen brothers ,
 but home fries' brand of laboured hipness would be foreign to geniuses like ethan and joel .
 it's raising arizona without babies , without charm , without laughs , without human characters , and without intelligence ;
 worst of all , it's creepy .
 what's funny about threatening to gun down a pregnant woman with a machine gun ?
 ( unless the woman in question is a spice girl . )
 take out the helicopters , the quasi-incestuous relationship between the mother and her sons ( it is absolutely illogical , within the movie's framework , that dorian still lives with his mother and brother ) , and the scenes of murder ( attempted and otherwise ) , and
 what are you left with ?
 the story of a single woman with child
 who works at a fast food joint ( but dreams of becoming a country singer ) .
 that could turn out to be the most boring movie ever made ,
 but it'd be better than home fries .

the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from " l . a . confidential " to " palmetto " to " the big lebowski , " has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors .
 with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class ,
 while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir .
 " wild things " could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller ,
 but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture .
 overacted , overwrought and overlong , " wild things " is a confused mess , a movie
 that wants to have its cake and eat it too .
 with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness .
 in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon ,
 who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal ,
 " wild things " not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc .
 there's not one redeeming quality in the picture
 that is not technical .
 directed by john mcnaughton ( " henry : portrait of a serial killer " ) , " wild things " follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher
 who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community .
 particularly one .
 kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that
 she offers to wash his jeep with a partner .
 soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house .
 next thing , she cries rape .
 and the so-called " roller-coaster ride " ensues .
 a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash
 that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial
 where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen .
 even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer .
 he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray .
 you can tell
 mcnaughton knew
 he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role .
 as ridiculous as it sounds ,
 he's the most sane character in the movie .
 the community is astonished .
 reporters flee to the scene .
 there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) .
 there's the ambiguous cop
( kevin bacon , who also executive produced )
 who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust .
 we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful .
 like so many thrillers these days , including " the usual suspects " and " the game , "
 " wild things " eschews character for plot .
 mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera ,
 and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease ,
 as if he knows 
the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany " henry , " a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force .
 george clinton's score is a delight to behold .
 but it's the humans .
 the characters are mere devices for the " nasty " twists .
 what writer stephen peters does not grasp is
 this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable ,
 if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or
 we don't care for them .
 not even the unintentionally funny moments work .
 the people in " wild things " are not so much people as
 they are caricatures .
 then there's the erotic content ,
 which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois .
 and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes
 that has graced this country ,
 kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go .
 ironically , the wildest elements of " wild things " are not wild at all .

it rocks-
actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .
 they seem like dangerous rocks because 
they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , 
and when they land-once in a while ,
 when we need a break from the space sequences-
they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .
 ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made
 after they occur . )
 they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact .
 bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid
 before it travels beyond " zero barrier " and destroys our planet .
 why an oil driller ?
 they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .
 ( in one unintentionally ( ? ) hilarious sequence ,
 nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller
 they built based on his blueprints ;
 it is poorly constructed-
harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .
 we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )
 harry assembles the obligatory " ragtag " bunch of " cowboys " , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man
 who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .
 once they reach space ,
 we experience sequence after sequence of
 something going wrong-
perhaps the fact that
 they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ;
 i cannot count the number of times 
they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .
 whether or not they save the day ,
 i will not reveal .
 nor will you care .
 i will say this :
 you know you're in trouble when
 deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .
 willis has barely a chance to come alive ;
 ditto for affleck .
 their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .
 steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .
 " rockhound " , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish ,
 so they tape him to a chair ,
 where he spends most of the film .
 so why did they bring him up there to begin with ? 
rather , why write him into the film ?
 -give his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis ,
 who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : 
at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .
 i'm guessing
 he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel ,
 at least in my world where the sky is blue .
 liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ;
 suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( " aerosmith " ) songs grace the soundtrack .
 director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .
 ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . )
 whenever someone dies in this movie ,
 a crew member inevitably yells out " we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! "
 i must admit that
 not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one ,
 and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance ,
 as their skin was often covered in fake blood .
 armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .
 it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .
 it has a vivid soundmix .
 but at almost two-and-a-half hours ,
 i could not believe 
how little actually happened over the course of the story .
 the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people 
before they recover from titanic-fever .
 bollocks !
 the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-
erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of
 liv tyler tearing up while 
ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .
 remember a little film called jaws ?
 in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .
 they didn't much like each other at first ;
 eventually , they started to respect one another .
 one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .
 this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer ,
 who throw too many characters into the mix and expect
 we'll care about them on the grounds that 
the world is about to end .
 not once do we get the feeling that
 these characters are even acquaintances-
i'd be surprised if
 these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before
 " action " was called .
 a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that
 perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men
 who don't bare their souls ,
 who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .
 to this , i will respond that
the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even :
 this team couldn't build a birdhouse .
 and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-
a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-
i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact .
 i'd say
 it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies ,
 which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release .
 the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes .
 deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama ,
 with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking .
 the repeating cycle is as follows --
 the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that
 there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that
 the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .
 then we get to see the plan in action ,
 in some sequence utterly lacking suspense .
 the mission will barely fail ,
 and freeman will tell the country that 
the comet is still headed toward earth ,
 and there's a remote chance
 it will strike , but that
 the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .
 it goes on and on throughout the movie ,
 but every time freeman goes on tv ,
 we know 
his plan is going to fail .
 how do we know this ?
 because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , 
ads that feature freeman telling the nation that
 " the comet is still headed right for us " and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading .
 ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie .
 successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters
 that follow ,
 but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots .
 television is what's wrong with deep impact .
 the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc
 ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg )
 who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy .
 she thinks 
it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress ,
 and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area .
 when she goes nosing around cromwell ,
 he begs her to keep it under wraps .
 " i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . "
 she figures out
 what's really going on 
after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search ,
 where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet .
 upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until
 the president can hold a press conference ,
 at which she gets to ask the first question .
 and everyone knows ,
 if you get to ask the first question ,
 baby you're a star .
 leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth .
 and i'm sure 
it's comforting for her to know that ,
 even though the world's ending in a matter of months ,
 she's a cable news personality .
 so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up .
 such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out &gt;process .
 but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , 
the astronauts fail .
 they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces ,
 which means even more destruction to the earth .
 yeah , thanks , nasa .
 that's when
 freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people
 who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years .
 they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave .
 if the focus had been on people living inside these caves
 after the world had been destroyed , 
 deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie .
 instead we watch as
 a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife ,
 while people pack the highways out of town .
 the reasoning is , of course , that
 if a comet is going to strike ,
 they might as well be out in some scenic rural location .
 and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks .
 i'm sure it's comforting to know that ,
 even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes ,
 the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives .

" there will be another , "
 the ads for this sequel proclaimed ,
 and why not ?
 true , brandon lee is dead ,
 but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway .
 the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that
 a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie ,
 taking its own righteous vengeance against the world .
 given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions .
 of course , it doesn't .
 stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film ,
 when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs
 who tortured him and his girlfriend to death .
 i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality .
 in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover ,
 and then we watch in real-time as
 eric pays each perpetrator back in kind .
 it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight --
 but it's also horrifying and fascinating .
 city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully .
 there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this ,
 although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that
 it won't be much of a success .
 in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that
 reviewers were shut out of advance screenings .
 ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic ,
 since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) 
so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup .
 this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow
 who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead .
perez might have some screen presence if
 he's given something to do with himself ,
 but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face .
 at first , he's shivery and frightened ,
 but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave .
 he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child
 who narrated the first film .
 kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank .
 tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely
 as women come ,
 but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress .
 the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) ,
 but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop ,
 who plays a gaunt fellow named curve .
 iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one 
who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin 
that defines this film .
 like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination .
 in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound ,
 where bondage is the order of the day and
 hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&amp;m fantasies
 that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if
 they weren't distinctly secondhand .
 even the soundtrack is tired .
 more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately ,
 city of angels smacks baldly of product --
 it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look .
 critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope ,
 but his work isn't that bad per se .
 he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- 
if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery .
 his major stylistic failing is that
 he can't seem to direct an action scene ,
 and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie .
 but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't ,
 the performers who couldn't ,
 and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved .
 who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ?
 the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure
 their audience would know the difference .

late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states
 her greatest fear is having an " artificial conversation " with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) .
 the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members
 who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy .
 the film is a multi-million dollar testament to everything artificial .
 filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step
 this is an unquestionable disaster .
 prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field
 until he falls for stiles' freshman co-ed .
 at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out-doing the previous in how " cute "
 it can be .
the happy couple " psychoanalyze " each other ;
 they pick out a song because ,
 as prinze's dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains ,
 every couple needs a song ;
 he smells her shampoo ;
 she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know
 she wants to make love .
 then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart .
 why ?
 well , because they have to .
 otherwise the couple can't make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . 
down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic .
 scenes do not connect to each other 
and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism ,
 but this is handled so poorly that
 everything comes off random and stupid instead .
 a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre ,
 not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because
 an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat .
 the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well .
 stiles' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head ,
 prinze's roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool
 who can't meet women ,
 and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) .
 he is one of those famous porn stars
 who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns
 that are shot on film .
 you know , the average porn star .
 the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit
 everytime he's on screen ,
 the porn angle exists just so 
there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes .
 she is a porn star mostly
 so we know
 she's slutty ,
 so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . 
attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up .
 these characters are so insipid
 only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes .
 what happened here ?
 the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors 
( stiles especially seems to be going places ) .
 writer/director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak
 not even seasoned pros could pull it off .
 in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year's extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences .
 the direction is film-school-grad obvious .
 it's stylish in a hugely self conscious way
 which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of " cops , " characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where
 all the extras move in fast motion while
 the couple moves in extreme slow motion .
 plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera .
 this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . 
which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster
 but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she's all that .
 if he doesn't start making better choices fast 
his future films won't be so lucky .

for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers .
 apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing ,
 since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it . 
in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid .
 madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman
 who has piles of money and no apparent job ;
 she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp .
 she's been accused of having murdered an older man
 who was her lover .
 already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect --
 the first being that
 any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless
 she's under thirty 
( or at least looks it ) ,
 and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men .
 what's worse is that 
the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well .
 madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when
 she knew darned well
 he had a heart condition .
 ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how
 at least he died happy .
 this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . )
 anyway .
 willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer
 who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality .
 how do we know this ?
 because his character is set up with the token wife and kids .
 how obvious is it that
 he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ?
 and get kicked out of the house ?
 and get welcomed back anyway ?
 don't skip to the end yet ;
 we're just getting warmed up .
 dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie .
 most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery ,
 since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax 
( always the kink of choice among screenwriters
 who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs .
 don't ask .
 another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that
 unless it is critically important to the story ,
 it's insanely dull .
 what's worse is that
 body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes .
 the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes .
 the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- 
it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor .
 and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ? -- is one of those endings
 where you can almost see the exact * frame * where
 one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in .
 the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since
 he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f .
 everyone has to eat ,
 i guess ,
 but this isn't a meal ticket ,
 it's leftovers .

it was with great anticipation that 
i sat down to view braveheart last week 
as it premiered on american cable .
 the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed .
 it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner .
 what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film
 which was anything but the best picture of 1995 .
 what drags braveheart down is its screenplay .
 it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography
( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics
 that make you wish
 assistant directors were household names .
 but this does not save a misguided script .
 the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero ,
 but the viewer's only response to his " heroism " is intellectual :
 william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny ,
 so we have to root for him .
 but wallace's actions paint a different story .
 he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance .
 though one intellectually realizes
 wallace is on the right side ,
 the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , 
in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king .
 wallace speaks of freedom ,
 but his acts point toward vengeance .
 after kicking the english out of scotland ,
 he decides to invade england .
 this is evident of a " spartacus complex " ,
 and this example applies both historically and cinematically .
 the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ;
 the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay .
 it is a shame that
 such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film .
 horner's score tries to make emotional connection ,
 but the performances and the script do not help .
 gibson portrays wallace in such a way that
 the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him .
 this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time .

susan granger's review of " the watcher " ( universal )
 just what we need :
 another lurid , trashy serial killer saga .
 this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac
 who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent
 who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd .
 to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too .
 before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours
 before he strikes again .
 in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist ,
 played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in " the cell . "
 writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase ,
 revealing , early on , exactly whodunit 
since the killer says 
he and the cop " need each other to give meaning to our lives . "
plus , as reeves explains , " we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . "
 after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack .
 james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' 
while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone ' dude ' persona ,
 which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .
 chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member 
who manages to be convincing .
 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 ,
 " the watcher " is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 .
 the real torture is watching it .

ahh yes .
 the teenage romance .
 an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario 
that could only happen in the movies ,
 and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .
 and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .
 along now comes `down to you' .
 the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project ,
 which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .
 only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above .
 it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy
 that sticks to the boring game plan
 that we're accustomed to .
 this is the kind of romance 
that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .
 in strictly textbook fashion ,
 college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .
 they hit it off like
 a couple can only in the movies .
 from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .
 the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters ,
 who are frequently taking part in activities 
that . . . . well , only happen in the movies .
 fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal .
 freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple ,
 and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma 
that the movie should have centered around .
 zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue .
 rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) .
 even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' .
 maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .
 as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness
 to keep the gears from stopping entirely .
 perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny .
 the jokes are drawn from obvious sources 
and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .
 the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .
 even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end
 as they waited impatiently for
 the formula to run it's course .
 the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off 
in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .
 when this is the highlight reel ,
 you know
 the remaining film could leave something to be desired .
 in order to make a teen comedy work ,
 you've got to have characters
 that show something by way of depth and identity .
 `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters
 who were more than walking flashcards ,
 and the result was refreshing .
 no such luck with `down to you' .
 it's just a textbook romance where ,
 despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .
 and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal ,
 the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . . only in the movies' .

" virus " is the type of cliched , vacuous film
 that has been recylcled so many times before that
 you wonder why
 anyone would even bother putting work into making it .
 strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , " deep rising , " about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .
 prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's " leviathan , " 1989's " deep star six , " and all four " alien " pictures .
 " virus , " in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced ,
 but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence ,
 it sinks under the weight of the water
 that the film was shot on .
 based on a series of comic books , " virus " concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat ,
 which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .
 after discovering that
 the boat is slowly sinking ,
 ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .
 once the team reaches the russian ship ,
 they go on board to find that 
the place is seemingly deserted .
 after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs 
that something else is on the ship ,
 and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .
 one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) ,
 who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that
 a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station 
which then was transported down to the ship ,
 taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that
 humans are viruses
 that should be completely wiped out .
 if " virus " sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies ,
 you're correct .
 although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life ,
 the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head .
 the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the " creature " genre that 
it is amazing 
anyone would spend the money and time filming it
 when they could be making an original film .
 the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past ,
 but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .
 in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine ,
 but that is about it .
 although 1998's " halloween : h20 " was also a disappointment ,
 at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .
 donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's " the puppet masters , "
 although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic " invasion of the body snatchers , "
 where he was fabulous .
 the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin ,
 but it is fairly hard to say if
 he is good or not in the picture ,
 since he has nothing to do .
 basically , " virus " is another one of those films where
 a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house 
until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .
 it is not the worst of its type ,
 but it is far from one of the best ,
 and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?
 as long as some of them keep making money ,
 i suspect the answer is never .

over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing . 
partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo .
 a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr .
 as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world .
 thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 .
 now it's 14 years after toho's remake ,
 and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run .
 in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist
 who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant
 which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .
 when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river ,
 tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states .
 meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter .
 she'd like to be a reporter herself ,
 and when godzilla comes ashore ,
 she figures
 this is her big break .
 of course , with the big guy running amok in the city ,
 niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor " animal " palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government ,
 whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .
 together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla .
 with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies ,
 one would think 
emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla .
 he didn't .
 right up there with the lost world , 
godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .
 the plot is pretty much
 what we expect :
 the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city ,
 and it's up to our heroes to figure out why
 this thing is on its rampage and how
 it can be stopped ,
 while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .
 the script , however , is painfully bad .
 it's fraught with lines so corny ,
 they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions
 which make you think , " you idiot , " or " you stupid girl . "
 i suppose
 when you've got a movie with
 a giant lizard loose in new york ,
 any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .
 why is it that
 godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?
 why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings 
where they can lose sight of him ,
 when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?
 why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings 
when they miss godzilla ?
 why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers ,
 when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?
 okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky ,
 but hey , i was on a roll .
 broderick is usually a good actor ,
 but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay
 which seem to fight against him every step of the way .
 hank azaria does what he can ,
 but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .
 like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color .
 what really annoyed me was maria pitillo ,
 who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .
 casting must have been asleep on this one .
 the one bright spot here is jean reno ,
 who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role
 which is often comedic , quite unlike what
 we've seem him do in the past .
 although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster ,
 reno brings a style to the role of phillipe
 which makes him enjoyable .
 unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities .
 the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films
 that have come before it .
 this results in a significant amount of parody ,
 which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .
 most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief ,
 and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .
 although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture ,
 what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature 
whose ferocity is undermined by the humans
 he threatens ?
 if we can't take the characters seriously ,
 the threat they face is an empty one
 because we simply don't care
 what happens to them .
 godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be .
 far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters ,
 but here's a behemoth running through the city !
 there's bound to be a lot of casualties ,
 but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i . joe cartoon syndrome , 
where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time .
 in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire .
 none of the characters even remark upon this ability ,
 nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .
 it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that
 yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie .
 consider another punch pulled .
 through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie ,
 but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open ,
 it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room
 where godzilla ii is waiting patiently .
 it made me want to gag .
 emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film .
 with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more .
 however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies ,
 the movie ends up being something
 that just doesn't work .
 now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

before the remake of psycho appears ,
 we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder .
 as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars ,
 and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing .
 the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment .
 the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) ,
 who is not too happy when
 he discovers this affair .
 if i was paltrow , though ,
 i'd definitely go with mortensen .
 less wrinkles .
 anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition :
 he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife .
 mortensen agrees ,
 but the murder goes awry ,
 and the twists keep on coming as
 the film progresses .
 unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast .
 in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . )
 the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts .
 not too good for a 'thriller . '
 also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par .
 paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie .
 mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas ,
 but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent .
 which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film ,
 which is does .
 however , i doubt
 douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside .
 also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective .
 again , it's not a character
 we're seeing on the screen ,
 it's david suchet .
 the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc .
 the lighting is also interesting .
 however , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre ,
 and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway .
 the screenplay is o . k ,
 but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about
 douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again )
 and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched .
 the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow ,
 and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel .
 with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment .
 there are a few bright moments ,
 but they are far and few between .
 the last thing a thriller should be is boring ,
 and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas ,
 you wouldn't be missing anything 
if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .

coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers ,
 relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels .
 relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again ,
 but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work .
 divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when
 los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer ,
 and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases .
 to make things even more interesting ,
 it seems that
 the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation .
 fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies .
 they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives .
 this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content .
 the execution and style is different ,
 which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best .
 useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either ,
 obviously making this film longer than it should be .
 the actors are good , though -
 leo rossi is fine as usual ,
 and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career .
 signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast .
 but she won't have to worry about it in the future career ,
 since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway .

edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back ,
 and like his previous two , it is a working-class relationship picture .
 however , unlike his previous work , the film dwells on a more personal story , and with a female protagonist .
 and in no looking back , he stumbles , making a slow , boring film without the spark
 that enlivened his previous work .
 claudia ( lauren holly ) is a small town waitress
 who is feeling stifled by her life .
 she's at a turning point in her life , and feels as if 
she's going nowhere .
 her boyfriend , michael ( jon bon jovi ) , is broke and in a dead end job .
 if she were to marry him ,
 she'd never get a chance to escape this town .
 enter charlie ( edward burns ) , claudia's old flame .
 he skipped town several years before , without any explanations . . . even for claudia .
 he has come back to town to see her ,
 and suddenly she is torn .
 should she stay with stable michael , and never escape her hometown . . .
 or should she ignore her instincts and fall for charlie again .
 part of the answer lies in the character of her mother ( blythe danner ) ,
 who fell for the wrong man . . . and has spent her life pining for claudia's father to return .
 now it seems that
 claudia is about to make the same mistakes .
 at only a little past ninety minutes , no looking back is rather short for its genre .
 unfortunately , it seems much much longer .
 the storyline is simple and uninspired ,
 and there's a lack of energy to the whole proceedings ,
 which makes the entire drama rather tedious .
 edward burns makes a misstep by casting himself in the crucial role as the egomaniacal old flame .
 there's no one to restrain his ego ,
 which reigns unchecked .
 he walks into the room
 and lauren holly swoons . . . yeah , right .
 lauren holly does what she can with her central character .
 but we never understand why
 her character makes such pathetically bad decisions . . . 
and we never really care .
 bon jovi is the only sympathetic character in the whole movie .
 his acting talents are much greater than
 they might seem ,
 but he is given a mostly bland and ineffective role to work with .
 there's not much to recommend in no looking back .
 it's not that
 the film is bad . . .
 it's simply boring .
 there's no zest in any aspect of the film , and no reason to spend ninety minutes watching it .

i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days .
 for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another .
 such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures .
 the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps .
 the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places .
 sherman has just invented a new " youth drink " that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time .
 janet jackson is the love interest
 who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) .
 with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor ,
 who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers .
 with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the " buddy love " link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker .
 but one night , the beaker is knocked over 
and buddy love is regenerated . . .
 because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy .
 then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that
 i lost count after the first thirty minutes .
 and did i mention the part where
 larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ?
 the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about
 realizing who you are and
 what you can be in this world --
 with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene .
 pure and simple , the klumps is a failure .
 its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters ,
 and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes .
 any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process .
 it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash .
 hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes .
 the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family
 i have ever seen in cinema .
 everyone member of the family is a large person
 who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough .
 the grandma is an oversexed fiend
 who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts .
 the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings .
 the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .
 the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .
 sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .
 but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .
 the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because
 their conversations were short and direct .
 and you got the feeling that
 these crass people couldn't act like this all the time .
 the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt ,
 making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .
 after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises
 that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .
 its also a damn shame that
 the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects
 that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .
 even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .
 now that i think about it ,
 the worst thing about this film has to be
 all the money that it will make .
 people will be lined up around the block for it .
 the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 .
 eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles ,
 but he'll play every character in the movie .
 i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .

brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him .
 sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters .
 nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop
 who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . )
 an assassination takes place ,
 and santaro tries to peace together 
how it took place ,
 trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy .
 the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together .
 however , the film doesn't keep the mystery for long ,
 and once the big 'secret' is out concerning kevin dunne ,
 the film is at a dead end .
 although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film ,
 halfway through the film drops dead .
 the problem is that
 de palma doesn't have a strong story or characters to work with .
 he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques ,
 but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience ,
 and i quickly got bored .
 nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters ,
 but it's no use .
 they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable .
 yes , another problem with the film is that
 there's no-one to root for .
 we're supposed to be on cage's side ,
 because his character becomes nicer throughout the film .
 however , his change is sadly unbelievable .
 poor gary sinise's character is terrible ,
 who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way .
 the film's use of flashback quickly gets boring .
 while clever and interesting the first few times ,
 it quickly becomes apparent that
 flashbacks are being used because
 the film has nowhere to go .
 they certainly don't increase the tension or suspense of the movie .
 there is small thread of suspense running through the film ,
 but it certainly doesn't make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one .
 the script is lousy and contrived ,
 the characters flat and two dimensional .
 certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller .
 the most depressing aspect of the film is that
 it had potential .
 there's a good story buried in snake eyes ,
 it's just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks .
 it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end .
 while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy 'number cruncher' wrapped up in the case ,
 there's no way of altering the fact that
 snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance ,
 and unless you're a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided .

it's now the anniversary of the slayings of julie james' ( jennifer love hewitt ) best friends .
 still besieged by nightmarish memories of the man responsible for it all , she seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown .
 she can't concentrate on her schoolwork , can't get a good night's sleep , and is even frightened by the shadows and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club .
 everywhere she looks ,
 she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his hand .
 in the first movie , `i know what you did last summer' , julie and three of her friends accidentally kill a man , running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway .
 to cover their misdeed , they dump the body into the ocean .
 however , he never quite died and returned to hunt down julie and her friends .
 julie and one other , ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) , survived only to make this dismal sequal .
 needing some desparate rest and relaxation , she is elated to learn that
 her college roommate , karla ( brandy ) , has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical island .
 accompanying these two girls are karla's overbearing boyfriend , tyrell ( mehki phifer ) and a potential beau for julie .
 but was this contest too good to be true ?
 the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that
 seemed like love boat rejects .
 meanwhile , the hotel is practically deserted
 as the storm season is about to begin .
 this presumably creates a venue where
 they will be secluded and will have no possible means off the island .
 eventually , they will be hunted down during power outages and chased around during intense lightning storms .
 as you might have guessed ,
 somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously strange figure
 that is wearing a rubber slicker and wielding a hook .
 julie tries to convince her friends that
 the killer is on the island 
( an eerie touch is when she is singing " i will survive " at the karaoke bar 
and the words scroll " i still know . . . " ) ,
 but her friends chalk it up to paranoia .
 but the body count soon starts to rise ,
 and for julie , it's going to be the worst vacation of her life .
 the funny( yes , i used the word 'funny' ) thing about this movie is that
 i heard more chortling and giggling 
( maybe it was my giggling )
 than i heard screaming .
 this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest
 that never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness .
 there isn't even any suspense 
that leads up to the deaths .
 here's an appropriate example .
 knock-knock . " housekeeping " , says the diminuitive cleaning lady .
 the door suddenly opens up . slash .
 next victim !
 is there any reason to go and see this movie ?
 not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run around in circles for about 90 minutes .
 but i do want to say one thing about this movie
 that satisfied me .
 i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell ,
 who incessantly ranted and raved about his sexual libido .
 i secretly wished for him to get filleted .
 did he get 'hooked' ?
 well , let's just say that
 if he didn't ,
 i would give this film a grade of " d " .

lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 :
 episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle
 that features some nice special effects .
 after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . ' opening ,
the film starts with the opening yellow crawl
 that features in every star wars movie and computer game .
the plot is that
 the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman )
 jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .
 however , this simple blockade is not all it seems ,
 and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . )
 they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )
 star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters .
 the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .
 the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star ,
 and as the film goes on 
the drama becomes more and more non-existent .
 there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what
 the outcome is .
 the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story ,
 which doesn't help .
 there's no snap to make the film work ,
 it moves at a plod .
 the script is boring :
 all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother .
 there's no group spirit evident here ,
 and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders ,
 it's evident that
 not much is going to happen .
 the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .
 qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for .
 the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul ,
 if he had been given more screen time .
 maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history ,
 even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film
 ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . )
 anakin is annoying and unlikeable . , instead of cute and huggable 
as lucas no doubt intended .
 it's probably not surprising that
 his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .
 the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks ,
 although in the end none is provided in the film by him .
 although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys ,
 the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .
 the only good laugh is when
 his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer ,
 because i knew
 he wouldn't be able to talk for a while .
 queen amidala is a nothing in the film ,
 she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that
 she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin .
 again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here .
 the actors don't help the movie much either .
 liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .
 mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm .
 the casting director must have chose him because
 he's scottish like alec guinness :
 there's little other explanation for it .
 natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script ,
 but she delivers a spunky performance .
 and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .
 there's very little talent evident with him ,
 it's hard to see why
 lucas chose him when
 there are better child actors out there .
 he's not even very 'cute . '
 the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay .
 there's nothing impressive about them ,
 yet they complement the story well .
 the cgi takes away much of the human element , however .
 the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness 
that came from the stormtroopers .
 episode 1 is just disappointing .
 it's got high production values , but little else .
 the music is meandering , except near the end .
 the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for .
 the effects are nice , but dull .
 the plot goes on for half an hour longer than
 it should .
 there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair ,
 and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film .
 apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair
 that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see
 what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film .
 disappointing is barely the word .

five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when
 a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake .
 the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer
 that kills the girls off one by one 
( betcha didn't see that one coming ! ) .
 hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . # 1521 ) .
 two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore ,
 but they play different characters here .
 orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum 
( yes , the same character from number two ) .
 yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too .
 i'm telling you ,
 a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man wouldn't harm him at all !
 the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two
 that i thought could act ,
 well they seemed to have lost that ability .
 thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock ,
 which undid all the ill effects
 that i got from this film .
 the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .
 any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .
 the film is so pathetically predictable that
 every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded 
before it happens .
 there is no point in this film that
 any suspense is ever afoot .
 while we are on the subject of the story ,
 the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress .
 the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager's office .
 i'm sorry folks but
 this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more 
( if that is still possible ) .
 the script for this film is completely pathetic .
 the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .
 the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .
 here is an example of the wonderful dialog .
 the scene is
 two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .
 the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "
 this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy .
 now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after
 a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented .
 one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "
 i'm afraid folks that
 this is about
 as good as they get .
 now lets talk about the great special effects for this film .
 this obviously wasn't a big concern of the film makers . 
the killing scenes are so obviously faked that
 they go to the point of threatening the viewer's intelligence .
 a girl gets hacked with a knife 
and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie .
 are we trying to see
 how unrealistic we can get ?
 the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .
 in one shot , actress has cloths on ,
 camera angle changes ,
 actress seems to have lost clothing .
 very impressive trick !
 the one ( half ? ) plus that
 this film has going for it ,
 is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious .
 the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny ,
 and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film .
 however , this doesn't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny .
 in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down .
 i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic ,
 but there is no point here because
 there is nobody 
that i was impressed with in the least .

the first film produced by adam sandler's happy madison production company ( clever title eh ? ) is essentially a one joke movie ,
 much like the movies sandler stars in himself . 
however the difference here is that 
this one joke just isn't very funny .
 rob schneider stars as the title character , a scruffy fish tank cleaner 
who ends up becoming a " man-whore " to raise enough money to replace a wealthy client's custom made fish tank ,
 which deuce destroyed while staying in his home .
 deuce goes on numerous " dates " ,
 and each woman he goes out with has a " humorous " quirk about herself .
 one has narcolepsy ,
 one has tourette's syndrome ,
 one is a man . . . etc . etc .
 my problem is that
 we see all of these women in the film's trailer ,
 so why do i need to watch the movie ?
 seen the trailer . . .
 seen the film .
 only a quick cameo from norm macdonald ( and a follow up joke during the closing credits ) generates any chuckles .
 deuce bigalow : male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video ( a division of di$ney ) .
 the disc includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , and features the original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for mystery alaska , happy texas , and outside providence ) , an extremely brief production featurette ( which contains footage not used in the film ) , and storyboard-to-scene comparisons .
 yep , you read that right . . . 
there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd . 
two scenes are storyboarded . . .
 neither of which are particularly exciting .
 there are fight scenes in this movie ,
 so why aren't we seeing storyboards of those segments ( especially the parody moments from the matrix ) ?
 i wonder what's funnier :
 the fact that any moment in this film required storyboards or
 that di$ney thought
 fans of this film would want to see them ?
 deleted scenes ?
 sure .
 audio commentary ?
 you betcha .
 but storyboards ?
 come on .

tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience
 that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .
 the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage ,
 and , while it's evident that
 this could be a fascinating live production ,
 the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . 
enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .
 the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .
 tectonic plates has a storyline ,
 although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences .
 it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie 
( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , " look ! art ! " ) ,
 although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .
 because we're constantly made aware that
 we're watching a play or a movie ,
 it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas .
 they're not real , sympathetic , or believable .
 i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different ,
 but this particular experiment is not a success .
 tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal
 who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) .
 one day , he disappears , and ,
 fearing that he left because
 she was undeserving of his love ,
 madeleine travels to venice to kill herself .
 while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) ,
 who causes madeleine to re-think her decision .
 meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city ,
 where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host .
 with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else .
 however , as interesting as the film sounds 
( and i was excited to see it because
 the synopsis is promising ) ,
 it never really delivers .
 the tone is soporific ,
 the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting ,
 the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner
 ( although it doesn't take long for
 the viewer to determine that
 the story is largely unimportant ) ,
 and the symbolism is obvious .
 tectonic plates is trying to show that
 human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth ,
 but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point .
 there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages 
( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those 
who aren't bilingual ) .
 the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those
 who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because
 ( a ) it's different ,
 ( b ) it's not like anything
 they've seen before , and
 ( c ) it's pretentious .
 for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .

the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements
 after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , 
i've learned several rules 
which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :
 1 ) be wary of french comedies .
 these people like jerry lewis .
 2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up ,
 no matter how long you wait .
 3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching .
 4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography ,
 watch out !
 australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo ,
 but since weir and miller left for foreign shores ,
 finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult
 ( not impossible -- witness malcolm last year ) task .
 well , i ignored rules 3 &amp; 4 last night , and sat through a film
 that should be in the golden turkey awards .
 it's as if
 the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories
 that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .
 lots and lots of horses .
 the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship ,
 which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing ,
 because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .
 unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .
 highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them 
( while it's raining--
you'd think 
a woman studying medicine would know better ) .
 the photography is good ,
 but i kept wishing for b&amp;w--
everything seems sepia-colored anyway .
 actually , i wished 
i was watching swimming to cambodia instead ,
 but that's life .
 grade : z .
 avoid like the plague ,
 unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks .

capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension .
 alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in
 what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen .
 it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her .
 in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all ,
 it's so elegaic and limp .
 a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere ,
 but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning .
 at the end of the last film ( aliens ) ,
 ripley and two survivors were on their way home .
 unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod .
 the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent .
 ripley lives through the crash ;
 the others do not .
 the prison is a grim place ,
 even as prisons go -- 
it's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks ,
 which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against .
 lice are endemic ,
 and so ripley's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) .
 at first it looks like
 she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest
 until a company rescue ship can arrive ,
 but it doesn't stay that way .
 one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches ,
 and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck .
 worse , it looks like 
ripley herself has been impregnated . 
what's weird is
 how little tension this generates , except near the end ,
 when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable :
 loud music , shaky camerawork , etc .
 sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role ,
 and she does well with it ,
 but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack .
 the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do :
 the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence ,
 but they're not asked to do anything with it .
 in light of the impending sequel ,
 which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie ,
 i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that
 they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie .
 it's strange that
 some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story couldn't have driven the rest of it .

" from the director of " the nightmare before christmas " it said in the previews ,
 which i'm guessing was said
 to get people to go see the movie ,
 obviously it hasn't worked since
 the $75 million dollar movie has yet to break $5 million .
 to each it's own however ,
 since " monkey bone " is not only a bad movie all together , but technically well-made .
 a tragic waste of talent and incredible visual effects .
 stu miley is the genius behind the new phenomena " monkey bone " a crude comic strip ,
 that everyone wants to merchandise ,
 they go to great links to get it as well ,
 including dollars that let out fart powder .
 when stu and his girlfriend , julie ( bridget fonda ) are in a freak car accident
 ( you'll see )
 stu goes into a coma ,
 and while in his coma stu travels to i'm guessing dark town ,
 where all the characters in dreams come to life .
 people are stuck in this town ,
 with their nightmares roaming around them .
 when stu spots monkey bone 
( whom he really can't stand )
 he tries to keep him under control .
 making a new friend kitty ( rose mcgowan ) he learns that
 if he gets an exit pass from death ,
 he can go back up and live his life .
 when monkey bone and stu steal a pass ,
 monkey bone becomes a trader and takes it and goes into stu's body .
 now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder ,
 so everyone has nightmares . . . or something like that .
 rather complex ( in fact more than it needs to be ) " monkey bone " had potential in the script and even the story .
 what is considerably noticeable is the gaping plot holes , and lack of character development .
 for instance we really don't get to know 
who stu or julie are ,
 so why should we even care ?
 kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her ,
 but we are not given a chance to know her .
 the cast is decent however ,
 brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in the role as stu miley , but becomes awfully annoying 
when monkey bone takes over his body .
 bridget fonda is dreary and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt ,
 her performance is bad and 
she seems miscast .
 dave foley isn't given enough to do , as well as " will &amp; grace's " megan mullally
 who can be funny .
 the standout performance is the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself , 
he is very funny and entertaining and really keeps the film from being a total bust .
 the special effects of " monkey bone " is what might really bring in some curious viewers ,
 these special effects are highly effective , and nice to look at with the eyes .
 some of them are believable and some unbelievable . . . 
for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little ,
 you really don't realize that
 he is animated . . .
 but on occasion it sneaks up on you .
 the direction by henry selick is good ,
 but at times he doesn't know what kind of film
 he wants to make ,
 and the ending climax falls off the cliff .
 it's too bad really ,
 " monkey bone " could have been a real good movie ,
 but with it's heavily done hack job , and lack of character development
 it just sinks when 
the end credits role .
 for those curious however ,
 it might be worth the rental ,
 but other than that avoid this one .

numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci-fi , suspense thrillers .
 soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring .
 the problem with such mixed genes is that
 the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down
 before production got off the ground .
 besides this , the action is mediocre 
when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age .
 the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography .
 russell who is usually a good actor in b-grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd ,
 who seems more like a sergeant toad .
 besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie-like
 which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience .
 this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson ,
 whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth .
 although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former ,
 it is still a long way from anything considered desirable .

a documentary from the twin hughes brothers , allen and albert ( dead presidents , menace ii society ) , about street pimps ,
 all of whom are african-american .
 an offscreen interviewer questions them about their lives and profession .
 it is mostly the pimps
 who do the talking for their ho's ,
 and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be , is what you get .
 i learned that
 the word " bitch " is their favorite word ,
 as it seemed to crop up in every sentence
 they used .
 it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say ,
 but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about , 
then some of what they rap about might seem amusing .
 they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen ,
 in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money .
 it's also a power trip , accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them , mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place .
 this sleazy pic , soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears .
 these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face .
 the hughes brothers used as their pimp role models , the feather-hatted , fur-coated , diamond ring-wearing , gold chain wearing , flashy cadillac-cruising pimp of the late '70s blaxploitation movies--like the mack and willie dynamite .
 also used as reference , was iceberg slim's best-seller pimp , the story of my life .
 we meet pimps such as : fillmore slim , c-note , charm , k-red , gorgeous dre , bishop don magic juan , and rosebudd .
 they readily discuss their business arrangements : including percentages , lifestyles , knockin ( stealing another pimp's ho ) , and 
the thrill they get from 
women giving them money .
 these dudes needed no prompting to talk ,
 as they just love to brag about about themselves .
 " priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp .
 " doctors need nurses . so ho's need pimps . '' as he tries to persuasively make the same case
 all the other pimps in the film make ;
 that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors .
 the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , 
as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that
 their impression of a pimp , is that
 he's the lowest form of human .
 while , we are told ,
 in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style ,
 where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand ,
 and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community .
 we also see that
 the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable 
and we see how 
they treat them like dirt ,
 as the film implies that
 this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations .
 the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , 
as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .
 there are different styles of pimping ,
 but the film mentions them only as being " macks " and " players " or " real pimps " and " perpetrator pimps , "
 but no further clarity is attempted .
 it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word .
 the film could never get to the core
 of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way
 as he does ,
 as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps ,
 who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame .
 the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how
 a few pimps retired and
 what they are now up to . 
danny brown became a blues singer 
so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe . 
while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .

gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty
 who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement .
 as dad declares all out war ,
 gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true .
 gord doesn't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . "
 tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in
 what is essentially tom green's primal scream .
 so , if tom green screams in an empty theater ,
 does he make a sound ?
 it's clear that
 " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical 
and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad
 ( mom gets off easier 
when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) .
 while this may be of interest to his hard core fans ,
 there's little about green's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else .
 the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols' 'problem' 
( green's put together a first rate soundtrack )
 and yes , i laughed a few times .
 green's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages' scene repeatedly shown in the film's trailer ) are inspired comedy .
 but what's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend
 who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ?
 a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise 
until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs .
 younger ( by three years ) brother freddy's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one's worst fears regarding the film's title 
and green's infamous 'handling' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking 
as it would seem , doesn't make sense .
 by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film's end ,
 the overall effect is numbness .
 while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child's self esteem ,
 it's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .
 rip torn , what were you thinking ?

much ado about nothing .
 ah , how sweet the irony !
 it's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that 
whenever a critic knocks shakespeare
 they are only doing so through ignorance .
 he just doesn't " understand " shakespeare ,
 you will hear them say .
 the bard's work is apparently beyond criticism .
 what a load of old cobblers .
 if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh's film of shakespeare's " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word ,
 it's time to get a life .
 get monty python .
 get woody allen .
 get john waters .
 whatever .
 just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy .
 and banish this nonsense to
 where it belongs .
 drama and tragedy was shakespeare's strength .
 to my sensibilities - and i'm no stick in the mud -
 much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever .
 no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours
 i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going .
 the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend ,
 as this was our day out and
 i hadn't seen her in ages .
 but boy , does she owe me one !
 i won't spend too much time on the plot .
 basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older .
 there's some dark treachery amongst all this ,
 but everyone is so awfully jolly that
 you'd hardly know it .
 mind you , there's nothing wrong with the basic story .
 good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound .
 nothing wrong with most of the cast , either .
 branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers .
 the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare's original text .
 light comedy shouldn't be complex .
 yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend .
 for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh .
 the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves ,
 the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something .
 but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that
 this stuff is just so goddamn lame .
 this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that
 it leaves this viewer totally cold .
 ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl !
 ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes ! 
ho , ho , ho , she's so awfully clumsy !
 oh please !
 there's wit in here somewhere , 
i'm told .
 i call it pretentious .
 something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay .
 in the end , it's cringeworthy .
 watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience .
 comedy ?
 bah , humbug !

another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like " waking ned devine , " and a host of other popular low budget movies 
that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line .
 it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals
 who stick together through thick and thin .
 the strength of this film lies in its rational theme ,
 that smoking pot should be legalized
 since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol .
 the film is tolerable until after its first hour ,
 it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas .
 but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message .
 its message is especially appropriate nowadays 
considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia .
 the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future ,
 it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply .
 billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that
 military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country .
 everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home ,
 so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war .
 the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance ,
 but one that is better received late than never .
 there has to be some common sense in distinguishing 
what drugs should be legalized and 
how to educate the public on this ,
 rather than making it a police matter altogether .
 the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) ,
 who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide .
 the widow soon finds out 
her husband was a bigger bastard than
 she imagined .
 he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage .
 the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless .
 she also knows that
 he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) .
 what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that
 when conferring with honey , she finds out that
 he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .
 even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out
 as best they can ,
 the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .
 her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing .
 since she is an expert amateur horticulturist ,
 he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants ,
 which he grows for private use .
 the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity ,
 as grace works miracles with the plants
 which turn out to be high-quality stuff .
 for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ;
 for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) .
 the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed :
 the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice 
what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for ,
 the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control ,
 and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .
 the story becomes incredulous when
 grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer
instead of having matthew go ,
 because she finds out
 nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail .
 it is interesting to note , that
 no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you ,
 only that one can go to jail .
 the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and
 the film descended into a huge black hole ,
 whereby it never recovered its dignity .
 the film moves into the formula mode ,
 whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , 
as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) ,
 who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as
 she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity .
 things work out in a ridiculous way ,
 where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace ,
 where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood .
 there are a lot of silly giggles
 that come forth and 
the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before
 it comes to its belated finale ,
 as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone ,
 until it makes the audience feel good that
 the sweet old lady succeeded .
 this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that
 smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated
 as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .
 ummm !

" love to kill " starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent
 as time passes .
 at the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza ,
 who's an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman .
 danza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his .
 everything seems to be going well ,
 until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs .
 much confusion and mahem ensues , 
as the death is covered up and other associates of danza's begin to emerge , all after one thing or another .
 sound confusing ?
 it is .
 i think
 what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity .
 in some respects , it works .
 but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess .
 characters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals 
that occur off-screen .
 the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman's sister .
 but so little time is devoted to this part of the story ,
 we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , 
we don't really care
 what happens to them .
 well , i didn't , at least .
 one thing i will give the movie is that
 it's a complete departure for tony danza .
 here's a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , 
who's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy 
who always does the right thing .
 here , he plays a man
 who's just looking out for himself ,
 and if that means 
he needs to kill in order to save his own skin ,
 so be it .
 i was very impressed by his performance ,
 and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona .
 michael madsen is also good as an associate of danza's
 who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him .
 like i said ,
 it's not exactly a linear storyline .
 " love to kill " should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre ,
 but it's just too bad that
 the story doesn't really add up to much .
 the stars deserved better , and so did the audience .

whether you like the beatles or not , 
nobody wants to see the bee gee's take on some of the fab four's best known songs .
 well , maybe that's not true . . .
 maybe you're curious ,
 the way you have to look in your hanky
 after you blow your nose .
 you just have to know how bad bad can be .
 if that's the case ,
 rejoice ,
 because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that
 sgt . pepper's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world ,
 and thanks to our modern technological advances ,
 you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs .
 derived from the lyrics of various beatles' songs ,
 sgt . pepper's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 .
 of course , the movie was made eleven years later ,
 the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts ,
 peter frampton is the one and only billy shears ,
 and aside from being about a rock band ,
 the story doesn't correlate to the song at all .
 and oh , what joy -
 we're the lovely audience
 they'd like to take home with them .
 i don't think so .
 but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles' song ,
 whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields .
 the debate over this is really quite futile
 when it comes down to it ,
 because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? ! steve martin ? ! ? alice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70's fashion and faces .
 check please !
 the plot is a bit unclear .
 people with bad 70's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences
 that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers .
 mean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy &amp; co . 's instruments , calling dr . maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid .
 supposedly this is a horrible thing ?
 i guess in heartland ,
 the talent is pretty non-existent .
 meanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic " sex , drugs , and rock n' roll " thing ,
 leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy .
 she sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs . fields ! hey , wanna cookie ? ) all alone to sing a horrible rendition of " she's leaving home " , accompanied by those same creepy robots .
 but is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ?
 ya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ?
 well , there's some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop ,
 and i assume
 that's 
who it was .
 it's movies like this 
that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , " what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? "
 nobody will ever know ,
 but as a novelty , sgt . pepper's is one to examine .
 carol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they're all here .
 but why ? ? ? ?
 who knows .
 it's irrelevant .
 there's as much meaning to be found here as
 there is to be found in your belly-button lint ,
 although the latter may be more interesting .
 with the recent onslaught of 70's nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) ,
 let's pray this doesn't get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters .
 in the words of paul mccartney , live and let die .
 in fact , bury this one 
while you still can .

films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , 
whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) ,
 or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) ,
 but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before . 
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) ,
 who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen . 
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd . 
the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes . 
in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source . 
if you can get past the whole comic book thing ,
 you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes . 
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything ,
 but riddle me this :
 who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ? 
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end . 
it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath
who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision . 
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case . 
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium . 
upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes
 that even the police surgeon can't stomach . 
i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , 
so i won't go into the particulars here , 
other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay . 
in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper ,
 but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end . 
it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians 
because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts . 
and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days
 ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) . 
don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it . 
now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , 
and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did
 ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) . 
the print i saw wasn't completely finished
 ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , 
but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london
 and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks ,
 even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic . 
oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .
even the acting in from hell is solid ,
 with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent . 
ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles ,
 but the big surprise here is graham . 
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent ,
 but it actually wasn't half bad . 
the film , however , is all good .

every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio ,
 with every indication that it will be a stinker ,
 and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .
 mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .
 did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?
 the plot is deceptively simple .
 george washington carver high school is having student elections . 
tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .
 mr . " m " ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .
 and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .
 the dark side of such sleeper success is that ,
 because expectations were so low going in ,
 the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more  enthusiastic than they have any right to be .
 you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews ,
 which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .
 election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .
 what makes election so disappointing is that
 it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .
 the similarities are staggering : 
tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .
 max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .
 the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . 
the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .
 tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .
 max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive .
 the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .
 he even gets a bee sting .
 the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .
 he gets several bee stings .
 and so on .
 what happened ?
 how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points ,
 and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , 
from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?
 even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy . 
broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , 
and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .
 witherspoon is a revelation .
 it's early in the year , 
it's a comedy ,
 and teenagers have little clout ,
 but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .
 and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .
 one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .
 there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .
 i suppose that , coming from mtv films , 
i should expect no less . . . 
but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .
 as the screws tighten , 
and the tensions mount ,
 alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .
 it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs ,
 but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?
 even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .
 there's a lot to like in election ,
 but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven ,
 mark this as a disappointment .

you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .
 in order to make the film a success , 
all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars ,
 have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . 
no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body
 ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) .
 essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .
 it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative .
 but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .
 but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does ,
 because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .
 it couldn't have been the directing , 
because both films were helmed by the same woman .
 i haven't quite yet figured out
 what i liked so much about you've got mail ,
 but then again , is that really important ?
 if you like something so much , why even question it ? 
again , the storyline is as cliched as they come .
 tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain
 and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner .
 fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals
 because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . 
little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet ,
 only neither party knows the other person's true identity .
 the rest of the story isn'timportant 
because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .
 sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots ,
 but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .
 all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .
 but as foreseeable as the ending is ,
 it's so damn  cute and well-done that 
i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene
 the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .
 when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love ,
 i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that
 for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling .

" jaws " is a rare film that grabs your attention
 before it shows you a single image on screen . 
the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . 
then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . 
dah-dum .
 from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time ,
 taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .
 right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean ,
 and once " jaws " has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . 
perhaps what is most outstanding about " jaws " is how spielberg builds the movie .
 he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .
 unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .
 until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .
 he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .
 he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .
 the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .
 the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july ,
 and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches
 because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .
 brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .
 hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it --
 his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( " it's a perfect engine , an eating machine " ) make it that much more terrifying .
 when vaughn finally relents , 
hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .
 the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .
 " jaws " is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .
 it is like ten movies all rolled into one ,
 and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time 
( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by " star wars " ) .
 even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's psycho ,
  and it never seems to age .
 although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete ,
 none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .
 the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film
 because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , 
instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . 
scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time " jaws " was made ,
 but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . 
nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers
 because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .
 scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .
 " it's your first summer here , you know , " mayor vaughn warns him .
 dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in " american graffiti " ( 1973 ) and " the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz " ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .
 however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab ,
 a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .
 bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .
 he's slightly deranged ,
 and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .
 however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .
 quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .
 his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .
 shaw delivers the story in one long take ,
 and it is the best acting in the film .
 of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ;
 with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .
 a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real --
 having survived sinch the dinosaurs ,
 great whites do exist ,
 they can be as large as the shark in " jaws , "
 and they are a threat .
 every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy
 because lets us see how we look to the shark : 
a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .
 the shark in " jaws " was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed " bruce " by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .
 many have forgotten , but " jaws " was a sort of precursor to " waterworld " ( 1995 ) ,
 a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .
but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .

moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era --
 you've got to know how to allocate your resources . 
every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .
 in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , 
who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .
 in the movies , you end up with films like " spawn " , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .
 jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .
 he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .
 watching jackie in  operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , 
except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .
 but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .
 almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts ,
 and as chan does his own stunts ,
 the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .
 this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .
 this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .
 ( chan's first release in this country , " rumble in the bronx " , was supposedly set in new york ,
 but was filmed in vancouver ,
 and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )
 heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .
 in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu . 
jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs
 ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) . 
he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , " jackie , save us ! " , and misuse firearms .
 the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base
 so that he has to be carried everywhere ,
 and he's more pathetic than evil .
 en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .
 once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight
 that's even better than the one in face/off .
 this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions .
 ignore the gaping holes in the plot 
( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) .
 don't worry about the production values ,
 or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .
 just go see the movie .
 operation condor has pretentions of being a " raiders of the lost ark " knockoff ,
 but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him --
 with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie .
 however , you've got to go with what you've got ,
 and what you've got in jackie chan is something special --
 a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .

on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo .
 two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops 
until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .
 this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in " lumumba . " 
patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , " lumumba - death of a prophet , "
 virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .
 peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .
 we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .
 images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . 
jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . 
a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .
 his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence
 and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .
 at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world ,
 lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .
 as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .
 the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart
 as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .
 lumumba won't seek the help of the us ,
 knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .
 his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist
 and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . 
the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , 
the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , 
belgian troops violently intervene ,
 the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) 
and lumumba is refused access to his own country
 when he returns from a conference abroad .
 this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists
 who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .
 peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .
 ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .
 some colonial masters were better than others . )
 the effort involved in " lumumba " is quite ambitious 
 as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history
 that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .
 production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .
 the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .
 the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .
 the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .
 it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .
 the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes
 that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . 
i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .
 the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .
 high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .
 the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba
 who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . 
in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .
 " lumumba " is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .
 it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months 
and i give it a b+ .

apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x .
 i don't know the details of the fight ,
 but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .
 i've heard about this kind of thing happening before ,
 and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . 
as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film ,
 not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism ,
 but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .
 it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear ,
 but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .
 norton is one of those performers who becomes his character ,
 and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . 
he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .
 the film opens with a flashback ,
 in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .
 we find out that this lands him in prison ,
 and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .
 in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .
 much of the film is told in flashback ,
 and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .
 when derek is released , having served three years in prison ,
 he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ;
 derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand 
why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .
 what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people --
 they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .
 it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach ,
 but kaye has found the right note for his material .
 because american history x is a mainstream film , 
there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- 
some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .
 i partially disagree with this ,
 because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , 
it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- 
he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .
 the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable --
 his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .
 it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs ,
 and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .
 of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .
 it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . 
in addition to getting the look just right ,
 he's perfect for this role --
 derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting ,
 and norton does it all with ease .
 even when he's at his meanest , 
derek has a likable quality to him ,
 and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . 
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which
 the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .
 the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .
 visually , the film is very powerful .
 kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices ,
 and most of them work nicely --
 lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .
 but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .
 although the climactic scene is very moving ,
 the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . 
for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , 
it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .
 it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film.
 perhaps this last scene was the problem .
 it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good --
 in a time when so many movies are timid and weak ,
 american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .

one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her
 i was willing to see betsy's wedding .
 and she was shocked to hear that
 i actually liked it .
 her reaction was understandable when you consider that
 the film revolves around molly ringwald ,
 who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 . 
but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .
 and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years ,
 alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .
 written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .
 alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing --
and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .
 as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film ,
 but they are by far the least interesting .
 walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .
 ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .
 she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .
 she's supposed to be a dress designer ,
 but she looks more like a clown .
 and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .
 thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ;
 he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .
 the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family . ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .
 walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .
 when the two families meet and mingle ,
 the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , " money versus values . "
ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .
 sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .
 it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .
 lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry . 
lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .
 and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . 
lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting ,
 and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .
 i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born ,
 but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed . 
the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .
 joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties ,
 who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .
 alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .
 the film adopts alda's psychological point of view 
as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .
 as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .
 and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen ,
 alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians ,
 who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .
 their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba ,
 who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .
 with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .
 lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) ,
 but it was too late .
 'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . 
peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players ,
 although they frequently succumb to cliche ,
particularly regarding lumumba's private life .
 peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' 
when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . 
peck's direction is less assured ,
 with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .
 he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .
 ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country .
 lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .
 peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .
 " lumumba " is a story that deserves to be told 
and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .

the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .
 it's not a pretty death ,
 and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .
 sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .
 quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem . 
but too often hollywood gets it wrong ,
 even when they pay off chinese directors . 
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .
 mostly it's laughable .
 in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix ,
 trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .
 but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right . 
iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .
 but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .
 unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong ,
 iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .
 iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 .
 at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon ,
 director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .
 iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .
 however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .
 in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .
 while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .
 aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau .

after watching " rat race " last week ,
 i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud ,
 i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes .
 saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie
 and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first .
 " rat race " is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness .
 hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer .
 the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits
 that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy ,
 featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .
 then comes the setup .
 donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients .
 to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines .
 gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , " today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . "
 the competition is simple :
 each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash .
 there is a transmitter in every key ,
 so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead .
 the race has no rules ?
 whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money .
 since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes ,
 let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers .
 decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby .
 she finds that
 grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life .
 thrown together , it becomes clear that
 both women share a fierce competitive nature .
 owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america .
 an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game .
 after escaping from a vengeful cab driver ,
 owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention . mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america .
 he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times .
 pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation .
 randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas .
 fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race ,
 he claims that
 he must travel to silver city for a job interview . 
beverly insists the family stay together ,
 so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert .
 brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid .
 blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing ,
 and duane is the only person
 who can come close to understanding him .
 the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal . 
finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training
 who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey .
 at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome ,
 but all that changes when
 tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman . 
director jerry zucker ( " airplane , " " ghost " ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where
 sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers .
 as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , 
but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps .
 high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag
 that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off . 
had i been part of the filmmaking team ,
 i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron .
 it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation .
 i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence .
 my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? "
 but enough carping .
" rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast .
 see it ,
 see it again and
 when the dvd comes out , buy it ,
 because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .

i've noticed something lately that
 i've never thought of before .
 pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .
 have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed ,
 then when you look back ,
 you realize there was something missing ?
 more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films
 that evoke strong connotations of being a great film ,
 but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience ,
 you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .
 i'm not trying to say 
city of angels is that bad .
 it had a lot going for it ,
 but somewhere along the way , it faltered .
 somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all ,
 there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent  performances and glossy cinematography .
 the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .
 but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .
 nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel 
who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ;
 humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .
 meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor
 who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when
 we fight to keep someone alive .
 after losing a patient on the surgery table ,
 these questions envelope maggie ,
 and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .
 he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .
 angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch ,
 but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .
 seth's adoration is too much to resist ,
 and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly ,
 although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .
 the angels are interestingly presented ,
 all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities ,
 but it's a nice touch
 that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .
 cage is a wonderfully versatile actor 
( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you -
 what a combo ! )
 who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .
 it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .
 the two aren't very comparable to each other ,
 but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles ,
 and it's an impressive side of ryan
 movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .
 but even though the two leads do an impressive job , 
it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient
 who knows more than meets the eye .
 it's a shame that with so much going for it ,
 city of angels falters so much in its final stages ,
 leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there ,
 they just didn't know quite how to get to it .
 they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .
 filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth ,
 so after telling us for 60+ minutes that
 this film is a glorious masterpiece , 
they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .
 based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) ,
 city of angels is ninety percent success , 
enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings ,
 even the devastatingly disappointing ending .
 most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that
 which needs to be criticized .
 nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating ,
 which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers
 who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .

synopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) .
 bobby's world revolves around his friends , especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) .
 then one day , a new boarder arrives at bobby's house .
 ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man 
to whom bobby takes an immediate liking .
 as the bond between bobby and ted deepens ,
 bobby becomes privy to ted's great secret , an event
 which will change both of their lives forever .
 review : a small but enchanting movie ,
 " hearts in atlantis " easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film , " stand by me " ,
 both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys .
 " hearts " is a tribute to the magic of childhood , to those summers
 when the days seem neverending ,
 and nothing means more than your closest friends .
 unlike " stand by me " , there is a supernatural element to " hearts " ,
 but although it is key to the plot ,
 it is not prominent .
 like " stand by me " , this is a mostly character-driven film ,
 and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .
 yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .
 more splendid still is boorem ,
 whom i praised highly for her work in " along came a spider "
 and who is simply radiant here as carol .
 and then there is hopkins ,
 who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention 
every time he is onscreen .
 less successful is davis ,
 whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .
 i also found it odd that
 bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .
 but hicks' direction is lovely without being cloying ,
 and despite the movie's general lack of incident ,
 it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .

synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - -
 a young angry man from sierra leone
 who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .
 cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders ,
 but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , 
the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not
 they are legally slaves .
 technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time ,
 people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ;
 one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .
 lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove 
cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves ,
 in order to get them out of prison as free men .
 three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .
 a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax
 where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .
 opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .
 in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .
 real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .
 spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .
 djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .

the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever
 he or she intends to do .
 lives are often at stake ,
 and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .
 the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ;
 he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .
 most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that
 the end of the conflict is what he really wants .
 it takes a pretty smart person to do that .
 but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?
 what if he's also able to think on his feet ?
 in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?
 it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .
 in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .
 when his partner turns up shot to death 
and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home ,
 roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .
 faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .
 i don't quite remember if 
the captain actually said , " i hate to do this , but . . . " ,
 although it wouldn't surprise me
 if he did .
 luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .
 after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney ,
 roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming
 he has been framed .
 although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up ,
 gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey )
 which soon ensue . 
jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .
 the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist
 ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) ,
 that we as an audience have a difficult time believing
 he will carry out his threats .
 the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy
who is only trying to prove his innocence .
 how can we believe
 he's going to shoot a hostage ,
 no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?
 unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments ,
 and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .
 almost every time he's in a scene ,
 jackson steals it without looking back .
 when spacey appears ,
 the film has already run about a third of its course .
 his is an interesting character .
 made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .
 " i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , " he says .
 when he gets the call to action , however ,
 he quickly changes gears and becomes the man
 we expect him to be .
 soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse )
 who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents
 who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .
 this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .
 as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .
 gray really lucked out with this cast .
 david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .
 the only problem is the bit of typecasting
 that results from these choices :
 morse played a similar role in the rock ,
 rifkin played the d . a . in l . a . confidential ,
 and spencer played a police detective in cop land .
 with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .
 also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief
 he provides .
 his character is initially so slimy ,
 and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that
 you expect to laugh before
 he even says anything .
fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , 
but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension
 which gray manages to sustain throughout .
 j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .
 sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year ,
 and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .
 walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .
 for one of his best performances , check out sling blade ,
 in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .
 when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march ,
 walsh was one of the men 
to whom he credited his success 
( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .
 the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh ,
 and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role ,
 it certainly characterizes the type of character
 for which walsh had become most famous for playing .
 in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .
 we're served with the premise that
 two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner
 which will suit each of them best .
 as an audience , we're also given a situation where
 two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie ,
 and we'd like to see if
 one will dominate the film .
 both provide some pretty good entertainment .

plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon ,
 to whom he's devoted a tribute band
 in which he sings ,
 gets launched into stardom when
  the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .
 critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this .
 a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time .
 in the case of this film ,
 our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and
 as luck would have it
 ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) ,
 they need a new singer .
 his entry and adaptation to the whole " rock 'n roll " lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .
 although i will preface this by saying that 
one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it .
 metal was one of my first loves as a teen and
 even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore ,
 i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again .
 that's not to say that 
you won't like this film if
 you don't like the music ,
 but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie ,
 and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all .
 but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg .
 wow , hand this fella some major props ,
 as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god 
( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one
 if you ask me ) .
 he is this movie and
 i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through .
 he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic ,
 who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . 
aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend
 ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) ,
 but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes .
 i was also impressed by some of the " real " musicians
 who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) ,
 but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .
 it's to note that
 this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man
 who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer 
( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .
 just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements ,
 since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies ,
 but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .
 oh yeah , and for those who dig the " heavier " side of music ,
 the soundtrack also rocks ! !
 you see . . . dreams can come true . . . where's joblo coming from ? almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 )

carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .
 made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .
 sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit ,
 kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac ,
 hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron ,
 and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .
 the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs ,
 with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .
 this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when
 he needs to prove himself that
 he is a man after visiting dr . goode .
 the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : 
- " i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! "
 bernard thinks 
he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .
 there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother
 who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene ,
 and from kenneth connor as the expectant father
 who still thinks
 he's at work ( at the railway station ) .
 sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by
 getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .
 he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and
 she soon sees through him !
 the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .
 there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however
 her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .
 williams is , as usual , on top form ,
 but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and
 i would forgive anyone to forget that
 he was in the movie at all .
 the same does not go for charles hawtrey ,
 for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time ,
 he seems to steal every scene he is in .
 by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect ,
 the film seems to flounder ,
 but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .
 this film is genuinely funny and
 i could watch it again and again and not get bored !

the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because
 it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .
 based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place ,
 but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . 
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era
 where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .
 elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .
 however , as ness soon learns ,
 in order to stabilize peace ,
 you have to bend a few laws .
 the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .
 the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that
 he is not a violent man
 and he is a firm believer in following all laws .
 the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which
 one of capone's men bombs a restaurant
 that contains many innocent people including a little girl .
 from this point we know capone is evil ,
 not only because he kills without hesitation , 
but also because he is a lying bastard .
 right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone
 and he shows that
 this man must be brought down at all costs .
 this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .
 i found this approach to be very clever
 because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .
 the film only gets better from this point .
 with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .
 they walk in unison and 
they only look forward .
 as they walk down the streets 
they are observed and feared by citizens .
 holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , 
this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .
 one that comes to mind is " the matrix
 " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .
 wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style ,
 the similarities between these two are countless .
 " the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .
 the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .
 each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .
 he begins as a man
 who is determined to follow all laws
 no matter how unfair they may be .
 however , as the film develops
 so does ness .
 his beliefs involving the law are shattered when
 he realizes that 
those he trusted are actually members of the other side . 
he also begins to lose his stability when
 his adversaries begin to murder his friends .
 his anger becomes so thunderous that
 he can no longer hold it in .
 sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop
 who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .
 malone acts as a mentor to ness .
 he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ;
 when they attack with a knife ,
 you attack with a gun .
 connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .
 andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man
 who is just becoming a police officer .
 as ness grows ,
 he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that
 malone once taught him .
 charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member
 who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .
 smith is perfect for his role
 as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .
 the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed
 i have ever seen .
 also very similar to " the matrix , "
 they are exciting and intense .
 from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , 
the scenes are well thought out and well executed .
 the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .
 its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .
 the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .
 although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified ,
 this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action . 
some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years
 and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .

having not seen , " who framed roger rabbit " in over 10 years ,
 and not remembering much besides that
 i liked it then ,
 i decided to rent it recently .
 watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .
 aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies
 ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment 
it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .
 while the plot may be somewhat familiar
 the characters are original , especially baby herman ,
 and watching them together is a lot of fun .
 the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .
 cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work ,
 so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k . maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .
 maroon thinks that
 roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act 
before it costs him any more money in reshoots .
 valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .
 upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed
 and soon after acme is found dead
 and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .
 the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger
 as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .
 along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type
 who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon .
 ' `who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters
 ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .
 director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production ,
 which included hundreds of animators .
 also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .
 he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .
 according to the internet movie database , 
hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters 
and i guess his hard work paid off .
 `who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .
 one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers 
but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family 
( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) . 
do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . "

there's something about ben stiller
 that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .
 stiller currently has three projects in circulation ,
 and what other actor can lay claim to that ?
 he's in " there's something about mary , "
 which i * still * haven't seen .
 and he's in the acerbic " your friends &amp; neighbors , " playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri .
 now there's " permanent midnight , "
 in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl .
 there's also something about this industry
 that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures
 the minute they've proved themselves commercially .
 ewan mcgregor springs to mind 
who , after successful turns in " emma " and " brassed off , " received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , " trainspotting . "
 the philosophy appears to be a simple one :
 if you want 'em to be taken seriously ,
 make 'em do drugs .
 " permanent midnight " is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer
 who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .
 a habit , in stahl's own words , " the size of utah . "
 as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .
 unlike " trainspotting , " which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse ,
 " permanent midnight " instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .
 one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to " naked lunch " author william s . burroughs
 who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , " so i can shave . "
 stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in " permanent midnight " ;
 it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .
 while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl ,
 the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .
 " permanent midnight " shows how 
stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- " escape the drug scene " ( yeah , right ) ; 
why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) 
with whom he spent some rehab time . 
janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent
 who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith ,
 and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .
 stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck
 but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .
 the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see " permanent midnight " ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .

by phil curtolo
 mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .
 gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon 
whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as
 a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .
tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police ,
 but they contacted the fbi .
 minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .
 the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies
 that you've already seen ,
 and it was nothing more than that .
 that is until about half-way through the movie .
 suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom . but this is as close as you will ever get to it . instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "
 at this point , the plot thickened ,
 and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .
 the last half of the film is very well done .
 another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise ,
 as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .
 owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . " 
before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice &amp; men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .
 but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .
 gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .
 although most of the scenes were quite predictable ,
 ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film . ,

one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .
 the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .
 sometimes the stories are compelling .
 sometimes they're not .
 but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .
 star trek : insurrection is no exception .
 the film has gotten some negative reviews
 ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) ,
 but i'm not really sure why .
 it's an exciting , often hilarious movie 
that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .
 some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .
 others say the special effects are cheesy and that
 it's boring .
i simply enjoyed the film .
 insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ;
 the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) ,
 but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .
 of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ?
 leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f . murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .
 the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret
 to keep their race from dying .
 that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in :
 he realizes that
 moving the ba'ku would kill them
 ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .
 so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation
 to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .
 when dealing with a series with as much history as this ,
 it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode . 
this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ;
 in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .
 insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . 
stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .
 jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ;
 a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; 
and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .
 frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ;
 insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .
 this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation ,
 and the result is very pleasing to the eye :
 particularly in the climactic scenes ,
 in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet ,
 the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .
 if i have any complaint about the film ,
 it's that
 it tries to take a moral stance when
 it's not very appropriate to do so .
 i don't think it's that big of a deal that
 the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .
 better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ? 
insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . 
with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .
 i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .

a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! 
from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .
 1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big " breakthrough " role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .
 as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .
 not only did the film not do so hot at the box office ,
 but it was also panned by critics .
 as far as i know ,
 gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .
 the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres ,
 i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .
 however , due to the fact that
 hbo shows the movie every single day ,
 i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .
 and to my surprise , it grew on me .
 the plot is rather simple :
 broderick plays a guy named steven
 who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him
 when steven tries to break off the relationship .
 see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend ,robin ( leslie mann ) ,
 and he doesn't think
 he has any more room in his life for a new friend .
 also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .
 carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases ,
 which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . 
he apparently lives in his cable van ,
 and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey ,
 i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .
 for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .
 perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .
 and if you really want to see something ,
 you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's " somebody to love " , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .
 the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .
 i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend ,
 and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .
 also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .
 still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ;
 if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent ,
 i suggest you try it out .
 or if you have hbo ,
 just wait till it comes on
 ( you won't have to wait long . )
hell , that's what i do every day .

when bulworth ended ,
 i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ?
 it is possible for me to enjoy political satire .
 ? there have been several recent political films
 that didn't do a whole lot for me 
-- wag the dog , for instance , i found to be an intelligent but heartless film ,
 while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ? 
bulworth is a far better film than these , both in its execution and lasting impression .
 ? it's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture ,
 but it also has an emotional center --
 writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character 
, and , in turn , we like him and actually care about the story .
 ? beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ;
 the film opens 
and we see bulworth sobbing 
as he watches his television spots over and over again . ?
 he hasn't slept in days ,
 nor has he eaten , 
and , almost instantaneously , he goes insane . ?
 he's not stark raving mad ( not outright , anyway ) ,
 but he's definitely bonkers . ?
 it's the final weekend of his campaign ,
 and his assistant , murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto . ?
 bulworth begins the speech , but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ?
 " you mean , " one lady asks , " the democratic party doesn't care about the african american community ? " ?
 " well , " he shouts , laughing , " isn't that obvious ? "
 the story is propelled by a device
 in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life 
( he muses later that
 it's a bad thing to make decisions
 when you're suicidal ) ;
 he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel )
 whom he believes to be the hitman . ?
 bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry )
 with whom he becomes infatuated . ?
 suddenly , in the short span of this weekend ,
 bulworth's no-nonsense " truth in politics " methods become a national sensation ,
 and he shoots ahead in the polls 
despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences .
 &gt;beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ?
 his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ?
 here is a man who's reached his limit ,
 and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ?
 i like that
 the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general
 and how everything is run by the rich
 ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ?
 some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap 
that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ?
 much of the film is completely absurd ,
 but that's the fun part about it . ?
 it's an angry , serious film at the core ,
 but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ?
 what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ;
 this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale . ?
 beatty is so much fun to watch here --
 he's always funny ,
 but he's also subtle in ways
 that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions . ?
 beatty is so good that
 bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning .
 the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ?
 berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ?
 don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer
 who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ?
 oliver platt is an actor
 who should be careful ,
 for someday i fear
 he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting 
( though he's very funny to watch ) . ?
 paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections .
 is bulworth offensive ? ?
 i suppose some may see it that way . ?
 i wasn't offended by the film ,
 but then again , i hardly care about politics . ?
 i think that people
 who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ?
 the film isn't perfect , of course --
 the ending didn't quite work for me ,
 and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced
 ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ?
 but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ?
 bulworth is a smart , uproariously funny picture
 that proves to me that
 political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ?

call 911 for the cliche police if you must ,
 but the eyes are the window to the soul .
 the finest actors working in films are those
 who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman . 
you look at these men on screen and
 you can tell without them saying a word that
 there is something going on in their minds ,
 that the characters they play are real human beings .
 we will never have a chance to discover if
 tupac shakur could have been a great actor ,
 but he had that unique quality in his eyes .
 in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .
 shakur and roth play ezekiel " spoon " whitmore and alexander " stretch " rome , two detroit buddies
 who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .
 when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose ,
 spoon and stretch begin to wonder if
 they are living on borrowed time .
 they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab ,
 but that proves to be easier said than done .
 as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough ,
 spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .
 the government might be the least of their obstacles , however ,
 as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .
 in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all ,
 you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ;
 unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie ,
 they are going to government offices on new year's day ,
 in which case they should be thankful 
they get any help at all .
 gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down ,
 which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .
 in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because
 he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ;
 in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them
 before they can get into a rehab center .
 and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences ,
 writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation . 
one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , " do you expect the world to stop . . . just because you picked _today_ to clean up ? "
 the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down ,
 but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .
 hall has some interesting things to say about
 what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .
 a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police ,
 and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .
 in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ;
 another presents that old chestnut of
 the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime
 which shows their pictures .
 the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running ,
 while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .
 hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events ,
 perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent
 the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .
 oh , the irony of it .
 tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .
 in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone
 who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that
 it scares him .
 spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall ,
 but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct 
which struggle with his addiction .
 mostly it comes through those eyes ,
 eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .
 it is spoon
 who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite ,
 and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness
 ( he reveals that
 he is hiv positive even as
 he is preparing to shoot up again ) 
which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .
 gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch " helping " spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife ,
 and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how
 the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .
 with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies ,
 and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man
 who has seen too much .
 the tragedy now is that
 we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .

 hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .
 they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment .
 the premise is strictly sitcom and
 the photography is grainy as all get-out ,
 but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .
 originally rated nc-17 for language .
 not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .

for those of us who weren't yet born when
 the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around ,
 monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music
 that influenced our parents to be hippies .
 from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .
 but i give fair warning that
 i will reveal the ending ,
 which does not do the rest of the film the justice
 it deserves .
 shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert 
that precluded woodstock ,
 the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time . 
sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints ,
 but d . a . pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .
 no matter who is watching ,
 it all comes back to the talented musicians
 that stir your soul .
 the excitement starts before
 the music even begins .
 a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and
 when asked why by an interviewer ,
 she replies that
 she feels lucky to do so .
 there are moments of organized craziness as
john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .
 and when one band is tuning up ,
 a member remarks , " finally , a decent sound system ! "
 you can tell just by watching these first few moments that
 this show isn't about vanity ,
 it's about playing the music you love to those
 who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .
 this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .
 it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin
 as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .
 and while the lyrics to " wild thing " may not be all that complicated ,
 watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .
 even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage ,
 you can imagine being as enthralled by their work
 as the public sitting in those seats .
 the only drawback to the film is the ending ,
 which unfortunately i must reveal .
 all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .
 in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .
 for a film that's only 78 minutes long ,
 that's too large of a chunk ,
 especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .
 all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period 
that still holds sway over us .
 the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .
 if there was ever any question as to why
 most of these bands were so popular ,
 this is quickly dispelled .
 it's almost depressing to think that
 music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .

the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia ,
 which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .
 martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .
 unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .
 seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film
 that dealt with darker side of american organised crime . 
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy
 which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .
 goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that
 it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi
 ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .
 the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .
 at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .
 after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vitom ( played by joe pesci ) ,
 he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .
 three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises
 that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .
 wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough 
for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) ,
 who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .
 but the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart -
 tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .
 goodfellas is an excellent example of a film
 that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .
 scorsese managed to create a vision
 which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions
 that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .
 world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .
 scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime ,
 yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .
 after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) ,
 the audience understands why
 the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .
 scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner
 that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .
 with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary ,
 goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour
 that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .
 even if we don't pay attention to skills with which
 potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining ,
 we should admit that
 scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .
 first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot -
 relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .
 then , instead of single narrator ,
 scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film
 only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .
 this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .
 same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .
 nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs ,
 while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .
 but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment -
 almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .
 however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots
 that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .
 such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .
 fragmentary character of the screenplay ,
 which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .
 he uses this structure of film to experiment ,
 and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film .
 another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .
 the most respectable among them is robert de niro ,
 but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .
 joe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy ,
 and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .
 ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .
 liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .
 liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .
 lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife
 who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .
 paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso ,
 and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster
 who unknowingly digs his own grave .
 as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do -
 work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .
 because of this achievement ,
 and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers ,
 this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

" the blair witch project " was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film 
that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .
 its success made a sequel inevitable ,
 but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .
 after the release of " the blair witch project " ,
 tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .
 locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie ,
 and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , " get out of these woods and go home ! there is no goddamned blair witch ! " . 
jeff ( ) is one of those people ,
 who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .
 after he got released from the mental institution ,
 he created a mobile business 
that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .
 as the movie starts
 he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the " blair witch hunt " .
 among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen ,
 who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called " the blair witch : history or hysteria ? " ,
 and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .
 the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe ,
 who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying " the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . "
 this strange group plunges into the woods , where
 they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience .
 on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house ,
 strange things start happening .
 when they wake up 
their equipment is gone
 and only the tapes remain .
 after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies .
 they are somehow lost in time ,
 as it loops uncontrollably back and forth .
 they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares 
and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality .
 the only thing that they are sure of is that
 they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . .
 documentary director joe berlinger ( " paradice lost " ) helms " blair witch 2 " ,
 leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .
 the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach ,
 because instead of trying to cover similar ground ,
 it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .
 but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story ,
 that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .
 in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel .
 more money has been spent 
and more people have worked on a project
 that was doomed to fail .
 the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .
 of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality
 and profit is more important than the artistical values .
 from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , 
with carter burwell's ( " being john malkovich " and " fargo " ) musical score in the background ,
 you realize that
 with the exception of its title ,
 this film has absolutely nothing to do with " the blair witch project " .
 " blair witch . . " was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting
 that was mostly based on improvisation .
 in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere .
 with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look ,
 which is impossible to associate with the first installment .
 and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace
 that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times ,
 he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .
 the key is simplicity .
 " blair witch project " had a story
 which was incredibly simple .
 that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .
 the film was practically an empty screen ,
 on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .
 the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way .
 " book of shadows " feels incredibly controlled and restrict .
 here , very little is left to our imagination
 and the story is so complex and " clever "
 that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .
 there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that
 we can be satisfied with .
 this is simply a less artistic film
 that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor .
 it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed .
 but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie ,
 which doesn't allow it to destroy the original .
 in the end , i can't call it a bad effort . 
it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad .
 it's simply different .
 in fact , if you haven't seen " the blair witch project " ,
 you might like this film 
for what it is -- a cross between " the blair witch project " and the " scream " -films .
 the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting  ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .
 but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions ,
 every movie sequel is worse than the original
 and some are even not worth making .
 to me the story of " the blair witch project " seemed completed ,
 but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that " the book of shadows " is certainly assured .
 and it's already time to look forward to " blair witch 3 " .

seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .
 one of the best things about the movies is that
 they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that
 you might not have thought much of otherwise .
 with some films it might be just a secondary issue ,
 but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how
 it defines who we are ,
 which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting 
that could only happen in a movie .
 there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? '
 wherein the player takes on the role of a man
 who can't remember 
who he is , 
where he is
 and how he got there . 
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .
 the premise to this film is not unlike that game ,
 only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .
 we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city
 ( actually , it's more than just the city ,
 it's the whole reality )
 that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) ,
 but is so fully developed 
it's almost a different genre completely .
 later he will learn that
 his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) ,
 but for now he has no idea what's going on 
other than the fact something is not right .
 the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia 
and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .
 this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .
 the man doesn't know
 who he is nor
 where he's going
 and it's interesting to follow him since
 we the viewers have no idea either
 we can sympathize and identify with him .
 in fact , this is the way all stories begin
 since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until
 after we've observed them for a while .
 but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .
 eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold
 as it appears that
 john is a serial killer wanted by the police .
 we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man
 who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .
 two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .
 it was schreber
 who contacted john for reasons
 that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .
 he also contacts emma ,
 which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .
 but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' 
which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .
 everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance -
 considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design ,
 they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .
 however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .
 by continuing to follow john as
 he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know ,
 we come to realize that
 it's all a hoax .
 everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens 
to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts
 to somehow save themselves from extinction .
 but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . '
 for reasons that are never clearly explained ,
 it appears that
 john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much
 whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .
 the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .
 at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made ,
 they awake and either
 continue where they left off or begin a new life
 they have no idea 
they did not have until then .
 this premise certainly is interesting 
and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .
 he does provide some explanations such as that
 dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because 
he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . 
the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see
 who will change
 and who will not .
 in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies
 that could be applied to the real world .
 however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart 
as to what makes a person
 who he or she is .
 the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery
 which never actually happened ,
 yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions
 it comes off as distant , static and cold
 ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .
 for example , john realizes
 emma is not and probably never was his wife
 so he does not feel an emotional bond to her ,
 yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot ,
 we are expected to believe
 they do have a genuine love for each other ,
 which is also part of the film's climax and ending .
 and that's what
 proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .
 ironically , this is what made his first film
 `the crow' work so well ,
 which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .
 with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .
 still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .
 there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all
 which accounts for at least half the reasons
 the film is able to tell the story
 it does .
 the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .
 `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .

linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction ,
 and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable .
 she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker
 who's lost her faith .
 one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom .
 he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god ,
 and he needs her help :
 she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-
the fate of the universe depends on it .
 god would do it him/herself ,
 but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again .
 bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the " prophets " jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels
 who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far .
 at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) " thirteenth apostle " ,
 and offers his assistance ,
 as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) .
 it's a wild ride .
 they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-
this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) ,
 who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole 
that will enable their return .
 loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that
 his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates .
 at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets .
 it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene
 that asks , " how corrupt are you ? " .
 wings of desire this ain't .
 since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director ,
 particularly in terms of working with actors .
 ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-
between jokes , he's wooden . )
 his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years ,
 though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) ,
 nor has his writing-
his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another .
 dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately ,
 but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition .
 as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever .
 any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) ,
 and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack .
 a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game ,
 in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when
 we've heard enough .
 because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax ,
 said rant is given a great deal of screen time .
 sure , affleck deserved a big moment
 ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) ,
 but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated .
 like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge 
who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker .
 dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade ,
 with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-
a shit demon attacks our heroes !
 smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour :
 his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan " catholicism wow ! " ) and the scatalogical ensures that
 nolover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .
 i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions .
 proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever .
 it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease ,
 for to read it ,
 one actually has to see dogma .
 the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that
 it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy .
 there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime ,
just so they could know for certain 
what they were rallying against .
 ( not one of them had watched it . ) 
every single person refused .
 smith and scorsese have a lot in common ,
 and so do the two films in question ,
 because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith .
 in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster .
 ( i felt sentimental about a religion
 i don't belong to .
 now that's powerful filmmaking . )
 smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god ,
 and that spirituality shines through .
 it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins .
 my religion is movies .
 when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine ,
 in a roundabout way they're attacking
 what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid .
 i therefore feel that ,
 although i'm no bible-thumper ,
 i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .

you've heard all the hype .
 you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .
 if you've read any reviews ,
 you've also probably heard that
 this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .
 you also may have heard that 
this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .
 believe the hype .
 the effects are stunning ,
 the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic ,
 the lightsaber duels are amazing ,
 and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .
 but there's something missing here ,
 and it isn't budget or effects -
 it's everything money * can't * buy .
 the actors struggle
 as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .
 the most successful at this is liam neeson
 who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .
 he is the anchor to this movie , as
 he is the one character 
who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .
 portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .
 amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured
 ( it appears as though 
she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .
 and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that
 he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .
 however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity ,
 and he does a good job .
 he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent ,
 and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than
 it might have been otherwise .
 in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit ,
 and that's one of the problems with this film .
 i would never call myself a " star wars " fan - 
especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days -
 but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .
 however , if you are the one person in america
 who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently ,
 or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters ,
 you may be hopelessly lost .
 for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .
 for those of you not recently steeped in " star wars " trivia ,
 emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition
 who was darth vader's master in " return of the jedi " and " empire strikes back . "
 so , obviously , his appearance in " phantom menace " is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .
 a lot of the movie is like that .
 r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances ,
 and it's obvious that
 lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .
 because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .
 same goes for jabba the hutt ,
 who doesn't look as much mean here as
 he does corpulent and lazy .
 even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film -
 tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) ,
 coruscant ( the cloud city from " empire strikes back " ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in " star wars " ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . 
 what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?
  the answer is that
  this one seems surprisingly empty .
  there's no meat - no substance -
  that makes you want to love the characters as
  they are ,
  not as they will be .
another problem is that
 there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .
 i was distracted by the fact that
 two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved ,
 making them look more like muppets than actual characters .
 and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief ,
 but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .
 unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind ,
 at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive " teenage mutant ninja turtles . "
 furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile ,
 thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .
 oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment -
 lucas has said that
 he designed this film for kids .
 well , he's done a good job .
 the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin ,
 but it was very hard
 for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .
 that's not jake lloyd's fault , though -
 he does a good job of being a cute kid ,
 which is apparently all
 lucas asked of him .
 that's another mistake , of course ,
 because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .
 warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !
 in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .
 the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks ,
 and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .
 he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .
 but the only indication the audience gets that
 this kid isn't all hearts and roses is
 yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .
 his explanation ? " his future is clouded . "
 ( warning : major spoiler ahead .
 enter at your own risk . )
 of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord
 who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . 
this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie ,
 but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .
 because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force ,
 obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .
 so , at the end of the movie ,
 we end where the saga actually begins -
 with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin " darth vader " skywalker .
 did this story need to be told ? 
i would say no .
 but is it a worthwhile movie to see ? absolutely .
 if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations ,
 and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle ,
 then this is your movie .
 the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .
 the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .
 and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . 
above all , this is a fun movie .
 not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .
 but fun .
 maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script ,
 and the guy who directed " empire " will direct . 
because if lucas does the next one himself , 
it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . : )

as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell ,
 there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot
 which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .
 the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .
 to see these bars blocking his face ,
 we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film .
 as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots ,
 no matter how innocent tibbs is ,
 he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .
 the bars show that
 tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly
 who he is ,
 instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous . 
this one shot amazes me
 because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .
 it perhaps may be the most powerful image
 i have seen in a film . 
" in the heat of the night " was the first and the best of the three films
 norman jewison directed concerning racism in america .
 jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism
 as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .
 in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .
 he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about
 how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .
 preceding the very original " a soldier's story " and the recently released " the hurricane , " "  in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .
 the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia
 who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town
 where is he not wanted .
 tibbs is a man
who rarely loses his temper
 and that is worth mentioning because
 he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .
 as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains ,
 tibbs is the perfect protagonist .
 poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character .
 never nervous and always commanding ,
 his speech patterns are very manipulative as
 they range from stentorian to soothing .
 however , unlike " the hurricane " where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger ,
 who won best actor for his excellent performance .
 as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him ,
 steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .
 he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .
 he would refer to tibbs as " boy " and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .
 as the film progresses though ,
 there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .
 he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces
 and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .
 what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that
 he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .
 he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .
 instead , it was apparent that 
he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .
 most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .
 this action would not have been realistic at all 
since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .
 jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .
 " in the heat of the night " shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's .
 it displays this perfectly .
 however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest .
 it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if
 jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim . 
there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes 
and some of the scenes during this time period were inane
 ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .
also , it is given that
 tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective
 who is the best at
 what he does ,
 but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and
 how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .
 the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .
 ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .
 he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , " in the heat of the night " and the even better " in cold blood . " )

in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that
 i believe 
it may be his best performance . 
ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character
 he personified in the mid-80's .
 in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth
 while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .
 you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer ,
 but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open .
 in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force ,
 it's simple yet truthful .
 he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .
 grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel
 that put him on the map .
 when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , 
we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as
 students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .
 grady points out , in his narration , that
 they only do so out of jealousy .
 their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one
 whom grady develops a mild affection for .
 leer is the kind of youth
 who seems to mechanically block out emotions .
 he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .
 he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers ,
 though his act is a little too calculated .
he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) .
 whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview 
i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .
 leer is similar , a guy
 who equates quirks with depth .
 tobey maguire fits well in the role .
 with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .
 but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ;
 he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .
 katie holmes plays hannah 
, a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants .
 this is a plot line i had trouble with .
 douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man
 who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .
 at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that
 someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady
 ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me ,
 after all i may just be a lowly internet critic 
but at least i still have all my teeth ) ,
 then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones .
 seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping .
 suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand
 ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) 
and i'm pontificating on why the hell
 jones would desire douglas .
 there is a movie in there somewhere .
 grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) ,
 who is his age , but also married to another professor .
 okay , maybe not so chivalrous .
 there is a great line in the film
 spoken by douglas about sara
 where he says , " she was a junkie for the printed word . lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice " .
 robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor
 who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm .
 downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual .
 he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance .
 the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor .
 i wish
 wonder boys had more of him .
 searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless ,
 for it meanders through its running time ,
 but that's part of its charm .
 and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because
 it takes place in a haven of literary academia ,
 a place i'm greatly fond of ,
 and a place rarely explored in american cinema .
 everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies )
that they happen to be privy to .
 i'm privy to films about literary types i . e . those individuals enthralled by the written word ,
 and if you are not so inclined 
it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch .
 the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations
 that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points .
 sometimes the dialogue is too clever ,
 but that's a problem
 i wish i found with films more often .
 another minor quibble is that
 early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters ,
 but as the story progresses
 it begins to open up .
 for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags .
 the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies ,
 where jokes exist as asides on the fringes ,
 like jokes in life often do 
 the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things .
curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films .
 he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style ,
 the comedy coming from the false gloom 
his characters put up .
 the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party ,
 but in a wonder boys party , it fits .
 the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen .
 it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies .
 many will find it slight , 
but i found much to savor among its subtleties .

plot : derek zoolander is a male model .
 he is also very dumb and impressionable .
 for that reason , he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret , that even he doesn't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia ,
 who wants to abolish child labor in his country .
 will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ? 
will zoolander ever grace the world his new " look " ?
 is this a funny movie ?
 find out below . . .
 critique : there's a place in our world for " stupid comedies " .
 films which don't pretend to take themselves seriously , are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes .
 there's also a time for them 
and many would argue that
 this difficult period of our history , might be an ideal circumstance during which to " relax " by watching something so completely frivolous .
 well , if you're in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment ,
 ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time .
 of course , comedies as such are usually very subjective
 and i could see how 
some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny ,
 while others will grant them the " stupid " , but consider it funny instead .
 i personally enjoyed it for the most part , cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping
 they released upon the fashion industry .
 snap !
 it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie , not taking themselves too seriously .
 and if you're the type of person 
who likes celebrity cameos in films 
, well , don't look any further because
 dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn , billy zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovny , natalie portman and many , many others .
 i especially liked andy dick's complete make-over as the masseuse . 
hi-larious !
 but with all films of this type ,
 there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesn't work .
 a few particulars which didn't strike my fancy included the bulimia and " orgy " sequence with christine taylor , the break-dance fighting ,
 and i also never get why
 they use real countries in plots like this
 ( why not just " make up " a country , instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) .
 i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general ,
 since she wasn't all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then
 ( more zoolander , dude ! ) .
 but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes
 which definitely did work for me !
 i almost pissed myself during the " gas station " disaster , absolutely adored the " walk-off " contest ( with david bowie as the judge , no less ) and appreciated many of zoolander's moronic one-liners
 ( " i was a merman . . . a merman ! ! " ) .
 and i dare you to get his " monkey " photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie
 ( " you're a monkey , derek . . . a monkey ! " )
 i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film ,
 both of which zipped and zagged , and established a nice rhythm to it all .
 again , it's to note that
 this movie is dumb and not for everyone ,
 but my guess is that 
if you laughed at the trailer ,
 you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well .
 if you thought
 the trailer was dumb ,
 skip this dodo bird
 and go rent austin powers again or something ,
 a film from which there is an obvious influence here .
 blue steel , baby . . . yeah ! ! !
 where's joblo coming from ? austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers 2 ( 7/10 ) - deuce bigalow ( 7/10 ) - dude , where's my car ( 7/10 ) - freddy got fingered ( 5/10 ) - jay &amp; silent bob strike back ( 8/10 ) - joe dirt ( 5/10 ) - meet the parents ( 8/10 ) - say it isn't so ( 3/10 )

unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi ,
 an artist whose palette is fabric .
 ostensibly , the film is a documentary ,
 but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .
 many scenes appear staged ,
 and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .
 the cinema verite effect is a conceit --
 genuine spontaneity is at a premium ,
 and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera 
( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .
 director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that
 he " couldn't care less about the truth " but was more interested in capturing " the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion . "
 despite violating nearly every rule of " legitimate " documentary film making , however ,
 unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .
 while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry ,
 it presents a fascinating , if incomplete , picture of designer mizrahi .
 this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study --
 he's funny , energetic , and eminently quotable .
 he has unusual views on just about everything , from fashion ( " it's about women not wanting to look like cows " ) to mary tyler moore ( " between her and jackie kennedy , they shaped this country " ) to style ( " it's almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs " ) .
 unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process 
by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .
 it's almost certainly different that
 anyone would imagine .
 the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look , including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies , then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .
 in particular , unzipped traces mizrahi's development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show ,
 which highlights a number of prominent models , including cindy crawford , naomi campbell , kate bush , and linda evangelista .
 on the technical side , a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .
 a variety of film stocks were used : super 8 , 16 mm black-and-white , and 35 mm color .
 there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- 
the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie ,
 and , during the climactic fashion show ,
 color is used to show the audience's perspective ,
 while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .
 nevertheless , some viewers will be put off by this treatment .
 while unzipped isn't an expose on the fashion industry per se ,
 keeve has enough clips of petulant models 
to make the viewer realize 
how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .
 overall , however , this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else ,
 and only when viewed from that perspective
 does unzipped succeed .
 when the designer declares that " everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- that's beautiful and liberating , "
 it fits perfectly with the image of him
 that unzipped has constructed .

dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .
 she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service
 that is unheard of in the states .
 she writes letters for the illiterate ,
 who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts .
 she+s quirky ,
 she+s elderly ,
 she+s caring .
 totally trustworthy , right ?
 not a chance .
 once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .
 one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father .
 shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus ,
 and the son is orphaned .
 days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament .
 through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon ,
 dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .
 this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , 
where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .
 films like this remind me as to what
 i enjoy about some foreign films .
 it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own .
 it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly .
 and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that .
 the focus is on the minute transformation of dora ,
 of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental .
 the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .
 dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .
 but neither side is trivialized .
 she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical ,
 who sees the problems with dora , if not initially .
 fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance ,
 but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira ,
 who plays josu ? .
 he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states .
 he is a natural , and never once grating .
 send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas .

the event of events is upon us .
 people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and
 die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .
 i don't think that
 america will ever actually recover from what
 this hurricane of a film has caused .
 it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that
 this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .
 anyone who tells you " it's just a movie " is either lying or clueless .
 it is clearly obvious that
 after the waiting and the hype
 actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .
 the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .
 but that does not mean that
 the film itself is bad .
 in fact , it is terrific .
 i strongly suspect that many of the people  who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .
 it is set some decades before 
the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .
 the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict
 that is raging :
 the trade federation , angry at some tax raise  that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .
 the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as " the force " ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .
 unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur ,
 the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant 
to try and get the republic senate to intervene .
 on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine ,
 where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .
 he is an innocent slave boy ,
 but " the force is strong with him "
 so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .
 as any self-respecting star wars fan should know ,
 anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .
from the beginning it is evident
 that this is not an actor's movie .
around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another ,
 and though the effects are seamless , 
the movie lacks soul . 
i think that
 although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade ,
 cinema should still be a human art
 and the phantom menace nearly defies this .
 this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far ,
 with plenty of broad comic relief to go around ,
 much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .
 he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick
 who says things like " exqueeze me ? " and " mesa go now , okeday ? " ,
 and although it is often amusing
 it is also inherently annoying . 
the visual effects are astounding 
( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them )
 and the movie is a thrilling triumph .
 if it lacks in plot and in acting
 it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .
 the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term " popcorn movie " .
 what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .
 even though it does seem like
 the man scores every single movie
 that comes out these days ,
 his work here is nothing short of brilliant .
 his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .
 the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .
 when you see " a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away " ,
 when the familiar music plays ,
 when the words " star wars " appear on screen ,
 you'll feel a tingle 
even if you didn't see the movie when
 it first came out in '77 .
 it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin ,
 a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and
 who will soon cross over to the dark side .
 it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the 
jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ;
 we know that it will do more harm than good ,
 but they do not .
 we not only feel more involved in the story ,
 but we feel like
 we're seeing the beginning of a saga
 that we have cherished for years .
 the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .
 it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ;
 it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .

sometimes a movie comes along
 that falls somewhat askew of the rest .
 some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " .
 some people simply call it " trash " .
 a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .
 definitely a generation-x aimed movie ,
 a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .
 whew !
 anyone in their 30's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .
 it's somewhat silly ,
 it's somewhat outrageous ,
 and it's definitely not your typical romance story ,
 but for the right audience , it works .
 a lot of hype has been surrounding this film 
due to the fact that
 it comes to us from the same team 
that brought us trainspotting .
 well sorry folks ,
 but i haven't seen trainspotting
 so i can't really compare .
 whether that works in this film's favor or not is beyond me .
 but i do know this :
 ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me .
 he was great !
  cameron diaz's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .
 the audience may find it difficult to care about her , 
thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after
 we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him .
 misguided ?
 you bet .
 loveable ?
 you bet .
 a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me 
when i realized
 it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah .
 this was just one more thing 
i didn't know about this movie 
when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .
 maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise ,
 but i think even if i had known ,
 i would have been just as happy .
 a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming !
 not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .

that thing you do ! ( r )
 tom hanks's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities 
you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice .
 it is the latter quality , however ,
 that becomes a hindrance ,
 for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that
 it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast .
 that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania
 that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when
 they score a major dance hit called , of course , " that thing you do ! "
 the group's members are , naturally a diverse group :
 there's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer
 who has aspirations in jazz .
along for the wonders' ride to success is jimmy's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) .
 hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 ,
 which hanks calls " the last innocent year . "
 the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music
 , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ;
 hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--
but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger ,
 which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after
 the end credits have rolled
 ( it's still playing in my mind 
as i write this ) .
 it should come as no surprise that
 hanks the director works well with the actors ,
 eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler ,
 who is remarkable in delivering the film's biggest and best dramatic moment .
 the work of the young ensemble is so natural that
 they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ;
 they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting " retro . "
 yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! ,
 it's nearly nice to a fault .
 while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days ,
 there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting .
 everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--
except toward the end ,
 but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness ,
 ending on an appropriately feel-good note . 
there isn't much of an edge throughout that thing--
the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks's turn as the wonders' manager--
and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it's bland .
 but a little niceness goes a long way these days ,
 and there's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ;
 it's just about impossible to hate .
 it's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia
 that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , " that thing you do ! " --quite possibly for days .
 to paraphrase a passage from the song :
 though i try and try to forget that song 
it is just so hard to do 
every time they play " that thing you do ! "

" he's back , and it's about time . " was the motto for this television series pilot
 ( i call it a pilot ,
 i don't care what 
fox network says )
 revival of the cult classic british tv show , doctor who ,
 that spawned no series ,
 which means there are no smart network execs out there
 ( not exactly news to a lot of people , i know ) .
 the motto was well chosen .
 the series was simple ,
 it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives
 who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies , including the evil daleks ,
 and the master ,
 who appears in this feature ,
 played very badly by eric roberts .
as good as this revival was ,
 there is something missing from it to make sure
 it was really doctor who .
 is it the acting ?
 hell , no !
 paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys
 who've played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy ,
 who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) .
 he looks right for the role , is a brilliant actor , and slips effortlessly into the role ,
 the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would .
 daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway , the doctor's first companion
 that he kisses on screen ,
 she is not your typical female companion
 who screams , and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor ,
 she is a tough , spunky american ,
 and ashbrook shows this well .
 young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee ,
 and i've seen him in other stuff 
in which he usually plays the punk kid
 who dies at the end ( this film included ) ,
 which , imho , wastes his talent .
 the only problem with the acting is eric roberts .
 one time he had to say to mcgann's doctor , " i always dress for the occasion . "
 but he broke it up , and said it so slowly that
 it wounded up sounding like a song lyric , " i always . . . dress . . . for the occasion . "
 you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act ,
 and who's also british ,
 like mcgann is as the doctor .
 executive producer phil segal said
 he was casted because
 fox insisted on having one american star in the role .
 i dunno who thought of casting him ,
 but if they're reading this :
 news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star !
 he rides on his sister's coattails ,
 and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him .
 is this problem the kisses to the past ?
 they have references to the show so subtle that
 non fans would not notice them ,
 only whovians would ,
 and they're good .
 is it the script or the movie as a whole ?
 the script is a classy piece of work , featuring a master
 who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue ,
 and the movie as a whole is one fans will love ,
 and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series .
 so what is it ?
 simple : no plot .
 the master , on his last legs , sends for the doctor to rescue him
 after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him .
 the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey ,
 but they accidentally land in san francisco , 1999 , december 31 ,
 where the master , with young street hood chang lee's help , opens the eye of harmony ,
 which will suck the earth through it at midnight
 if the doctor , with the help of female surgeon , dr . grace holloway , doesn't close it by then .
 virtually no plot .
 i was told
 the movie would've featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks ,
 but a lot of rewriting went on on the set .
 that shows how smart people are ,
 as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting ,
 and that would've gotten a four star rating out of me .

dreamworks pictures presents a jinks/ cohen company production kevin spacey annette bening " american beauty " thora birch allison janney peter gallagher mena suvari wes bentley and chris cooper co-producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l . hall , a . s . c . produced by bruce cohen &amp; dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes
 " both my wife and daughter think i'm this gigantic loser . and they're right . i have lost something . i didn't always feel this sedated . "
 with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life .
 lester works for an advertising agency .
 his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis
 he is suffering .
 estranged from both his wife and his daughter ,
 lester starts to crack under the stress .
 his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy .
 carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker .
 she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings .
 but inside she is desperate .
 unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing 
that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .
 the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter .
 a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .
 this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .
 not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her . 
some of the most telling characters are those 
that serve to highlight other characters .
 most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .
 she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .
 colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .
 his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley )
 who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's .
 in fact they are the next door neighbors .
 anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in " american beauty " .
 alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series " cybil " and creator of the new sitcom " oh grow up " , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .
 not one character in this film rings falsely .
 and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful .
 the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as " the graduate " or " lolita " .
 kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .
 his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life
 that is spiraling into old age .
 finally unable to deal with the lost soul 
that he has become ,
 lester tries to return to his youth .
 he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet .
 mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous ,
 that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , 
we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees .
 annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .
 carolyn burnham is a woman 
who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .
 unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder .
 ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .
 the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words .
 thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .
 jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in 
what is a dysfunctional family ,
 and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment .
 her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something 
that many parents should view as a warning .
 she is the prototypical trophy child .
 when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( " i'm so proud of you , honey . you didn't screw up once ! " ) ,
 the bitterness and resentment are palpable .
 thora birch is a young actress to watch . 
praise must also go to chris cooper
 who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance .
 colonel finn is a man in complete denial .
 his military upbringing masking a desire
 he is too repulsed to even comprehend .
 wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma .
 the boy next door who may be more foe than friend .
 a deceitful and calculating young man ,
 whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him .
 mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film .
 that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar ,
 that one almost faults the performance for it . 
director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style
 that is neither intrusive nor subtle .
 scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character .
 the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful ,
 capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty 
( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) .
 every nuance of " american beauty " begs it's audience to think and examine .
 it is a film
 that will be discussed and debated for years to come .
 and well it should ,
 as it is simply one of this years best .

will hunting ( matt damon ) is a natural genius .
 for a movie character , that's usually a death sentence .
 it's a trait associated with what my brother calls " too good for this world " movies , like phenomenon or powder .
 forgive me for spoiling the ending ,
 but will doesn't die .
 this is no formula movie .
 in fact , it's quite fresh and original .
 it's a character study more than anything ,
 and that's not surprising ,
 considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck .
 will works whatever kind of job
 he can get .
 first he's a janitor , 
then he works construction .
 off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject 
that interests him .
 on-screen he hangs out with his friends , picking fights in robust , romanticized-hemingway fashion .
 lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves ) , a math professor , learns that
 the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics .
 having confirmed he's not a fluke or a savant ,
 he does what
 he can to get will into the education system .
 he is firmly rejected .
 finally , will lands in jail for one of his fights .
 lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time
 as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him .
 will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison .
 lambeau treats will like a son .
 he's proud of , and amazed by , will's accomplishments in mathematics .
 he encourages will and tries to give him structure , knowing that ,
 with a little discipline , he could be bigger than einstein .
 will isn't really interested in academia .
 he knows
 he would be the best in his field , and therefore spend all of his time in an office , explaining math to people like lambeau .
 he would rather work construction ,
 which breaks lambeau's heart .
 meanwhile , will attends his mandated therapy sessions . 
it's not long before
 he shreds all the therapists on lambeau's " a " list .
 will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade ,
 and how to keep them from affecting him .
 shrink after shrink refuses to return after will's mockery .
 lambeau's last hope is his old college roommate , now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college .
 knowing that will is going to try to shred him too ,
 sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein .
 true to form , will finds sean's emotional weakness and attacks .
 but unlike the other shrinks , sean knows what
 he is in for and continues the sessions .
 like a foster mother with a fussy child ,
 sean knows that
 the attacks are defensive 
and is able to take them in stride .
 like the foster mother ,
 sean knows that
 time and quiet patience is the only approach .
 robin williams is excellent in this role .
 he's not an actor with a great range ,
 but in the right roles he has great depth .
 in this movie , as in awakenings , there comes a point when
 the quiet , shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance ,
 and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes .
 williams is the only actor i can name
 who can make an audience cry just by smiling .
 i have compared will to a foster child and 
that's not entirely fair .
 emotionally , he has a lot to learn , 
but he is not a child .
 he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about
 what he wants .
 sean , his girlfriend , his pals , and lambeau all help him grow ,
 but he didn't start out asking for , or particularly needing , help .
 his exceptional gift singled him out ,
 and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction .
 if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that
 it walks the line between drama and melodrama .
 it's too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama ,
 but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama .
 it is emotionally engaging ,
 but it's not quite larger than life .
 this isn't a problem per se ,
 but at times i didn't know quite how to take it .
 but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie .
 a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow .
 it doesn't just happen ;
 it takes a good script , good acting , and good direction .
 good will hunting has all three .
 if you are at all inclined to see it , by all means , go .

if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios ,
 it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . 
although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries
 which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) ,
 it's obvious
 there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .
 so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production ,
 it's a welcome change of pace for all
 who frequent the cineplexes .
 although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted ,
 pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .
 quite the opposite is true , 
in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen .
 the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .
 not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution ,
 and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work ,
 it is still a testament that
 his picture was considered worthy enough .
 kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .
 it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers
 who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named " pleasantville . "
 maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ;
 but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .
 it's not long before 
she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way -
 what life is * really * like .
 soon hues of color creep into the black and white world ,
 and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism ,
 others fear the strangeness .
 at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) 
and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ;
 but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas
 that soon involves the entire town .
 fine performances are turned in all around .
 maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads ,
 but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .
 daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character ,
 whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - 
almost to the point where
 you can sense gene hackman's envy .
 for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more -
 and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .
 also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen ,
 and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .
 there's not much to dislike about pleasantville ,
 and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for

 little known facts about this film and its stars :
 this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations , including best picture .
 it lost that award to chariots of fire , but did manage to win for best art direction , best special effects , best film editing and best sound .
 actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones ,
 but was committed to his hit tv show , " magnum p . i . " .
 in filming the well of souls sequence ,
 the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake
 they could lay their hands on .
 hence there are snakes
 that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .
 however , once all the snakes were on set ,
 it became clear that
 there were not nearly enough of them ,
 so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths ,
 and these were used as well .
 looking closely , you can tell
 which are the real snakes
 and which are not .
 an early draft of the script had
 indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra .
 during his escape from the museum 
where it was housed ,
 he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .
 also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence .
 both of these scenes were cut from the script ,
 but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom .
 this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle
 which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo .
 the same type of opening is present in its sequels . 
jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number " ob-cpo " .
 this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) .
 also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po .
 they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as 
they remove the ark .
 the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip .
 as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened . 
spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if 
indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy .
 the entire crew laughed and
 that's how it was filmed .
 when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra ,
 you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that .
 when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside ,
 you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .

`we run tings . tings don't run we . ' -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) .
 jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .
 capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters
 that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .
 when he arrives ,
 he discovers that 
the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , 
thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named
 because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .
 capone discovers that
 wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and ,
 much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .
 torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend ,
 capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .
 directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) ,
 one hardly notices
 the film was shot on video after a while .
 shots are handled so efficiently that
 they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films ,
 although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as
 most of woo's films are .
 the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though ,
 and eventually begin to take on a life of their own 
( beyond the hong kong films that
 they are obviously patterned after ) .
 the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well ,
 with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .
 the cast is superb and
 listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest .
 paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .
 mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler 
who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . 
unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do
 and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective 
( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) ,
 but then again , that could be the way 
his character was intended to be portrayed .
 the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs ,
 and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie
( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .
 the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote
 that opens this review .
 oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman ,
 and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film
 ( that i could see ) ,
 which is virtually unheard of here in the us .
 at the time of this writing ,
 third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us ,
 coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica ,
 where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica ,
 which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) .
 palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and
 considering that their main focus is the dvd market ,
 i can imagine that
 a disc will be available 
once the film has left theaters .
 chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman ,
 so i'd say he has a pretty good track record .
 overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .
 if action films are your thing and
 you don't mind intermittent subtitles ,
 then you can't go wrong with this film .
 the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched )
 and the action is tight .
 i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , 
but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .

at first glance , it appears that
 the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .
 that's true of home alone 2
 and i'd bet money that
 it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .
 but home alone actually has a lot going for it ,
 and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .
 the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays .
 four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .
 the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty .
 kevin's patience runs out when 
he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten ,
 and he's going to have to starve .
 he attacks his big bully brother buzz ,
 who had been teasing him .
 the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .
 the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .
 nobody came to his rescue when
 he was being teased ,
 but they all point their fingers when
 he fights back .
 the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara )
 who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .
 on his way up the stairs , he tells her that
 " families suck " and that
 he hopes never to see any of his family again .
 that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks ,
 so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .
 in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for ,
 and the family heads off without him .
 it's interesting that , in a subtle way ,
 his parents never noticed him missing 
because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children . 
first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second ,
 they put all the kids in coach
 while they fly first class . 
they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before
 they realize
 they are missing a child .
 meanwhile , kevin believes that
 somehow his wish has come true .
 he's finally rid of his family !
 life is a dream come true .
 he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .
 slowly , the novelty wears off and
 he settles into the mundane .
 he grooms himself ,
 he does the laundry ,
 he goes shopping ( " i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener " ) .
 he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security
 they bring .
 the furnace in the basement is a scary monster ,
 the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer ,
 and two crooks are trying to break into his house .
 macaulay culkin is cute but
 he isn't much of an actor .
 still , we can see that
 kevin's character grows ,
 thanks to some good direction and editing .
 for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where
 kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , 
just as " santa " is getting in his car .
 kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa . 
he learned how to deal with the furnace .
 you turn on the lights and 
it's not so scary anymore .
 he goes to a church one evening and
 there he sees the snow-shovel murderer ,
 who actually turns out to be a nice man .
 they talk about their fears
 and kevin learns that 
age alone does not make you less afraid .
 finally , in the last 20 minutes ,
 kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .
 this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick ,
 and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup ,
 it is dessert .
 it's a lot of fun ,
 and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .
 on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .
 john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music
 without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls ,
 and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings . 
but it does have its flaws .
 the smallest problem is that
 culkin doesn't act very well .
 as i said before ,
 he is cute ,
 but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .
 the biggest problem is that
 during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .
 instead of " i'm gonna get that kid "
 they say " i'm gonna kill that kid . "
 some might argue that
 the tone is the same ,
 but i strongly disagree .
 mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .
 i'll probably never see home alone 3 ,
 and i wish
 i had skipped home alone 2 ,
 but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .
 don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original ,
 which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .

-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 --
 starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers --
 directed by joe dante and written by charles hass --
 summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant ! to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .
 he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . 
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and
 how life affects them .
 quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .
 the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .
 unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .
 the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .
 the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master .
 so i would definitely recommend this film to
 anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .
 longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers]
 the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that
 while being a comedy ,
 the film also had an intelligent story to tell .
 too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that
 a comedy need only make you laugh .
 you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you .
 matinee is not like that .
 i left the picture thinking about what
 i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .
 i found myself wondering
 what would happen to the characters of the film .
 but most importantly , i found myself caring about
 what would happen to the characters .
 the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film
 he brings to key west .
 i believe that
 goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .
 he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .
 i felt
 he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .
 the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature ,
 however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film .
 the movie is really the story of the four teenagers ,
 discovering who they are and
 what they want , against a background where 
at any minute it could all end .
 i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . 
they tried to block it out ,
 they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . 
unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time .
 while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens ,
 there was a great deal of overlap .
 several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .
 one example is a scene where
 people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .
 if you think about it
 the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy ,
 but it works here .
 another reason i like this film is that
 i like b- science fiction movies .
 one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .
 ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . )
 while mant ! never got made ,
 many films like it were ,
 and mant ! serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves . 
so again i would like to recommend matinee to 
anybody looking for a good , humorous story .
 this isn't a gag film like many other comedies
 but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .
 enjoy !

when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago ,
 the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .
 when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars ,
 we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships .
 when han solo goes light speed ,
 the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines
 that converge at an invisible point . 
cool .
 _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--
that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .
 was it really only forty years ago ,
 when sputnik was launched ,
 and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?
 have we become so technologically advanced that
 we have forgotten that it
 was nearly two generations ago
 where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement ,
 even though it was from the russians ?
 it sounds hokey ,
 but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ ,
 i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .
 determined to make a dent in the space race ,
 he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket
 that could fly like the best of them .
 it is films like this that
 we know the ending as
 we buy the ticket .
 when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that
 he enters his findings into the national science fair ,
 we know exactly 
who is going to win .
 but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .
 for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .
 if he has any strengths whatsoever ,
 it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .
 it means that
 he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school ,
 who knows more about rocket science than
 he does .
 it means that if
 his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) ,
 he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets ,
 which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .
 homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .
 here he plays the antithesis of the character
 he played in _matewan_ :
 instead of organizing union rallies ,
 he is the head of the coal-miners ,
 who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .
 this is will be one of the &gt;great unnoticed performances of the year :
 note how multi-dimensional his character is .
 he is his son+s last nemesis , as one
 who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .
 but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed
 the only way he knows how .
 through coal-mining .
 because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .
 the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .
 we don+t understand that
 there were the generations from the industrial revolution
 who knew of no other way to raise a family .
 the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet ,
 and he knew of no other life .
 so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .
 and this is the best type of inspirational film ;
 the one that you take something with you .
 btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background . 
another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .

warning : contains what the matrix is .
 rated r for sci-fi violence .
 starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano .
 some may be disappointed with the matrix .
 i'll tell you i was .
 i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .
 now wait wait ,
 i know most of you loved it ,
 and i'm not saying
 i didn't like it .
 what i'm saying is 
the first half was extremely slow .
 now seeing the trailer
 it makes you think
 the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . 
don't be fooled ,
 this movie has a big story .
 and big chunks of talky moments .
 but i will admit
 the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .
 ok now to the story . 
well this may take a while .
 ok first of all ,
 our world we live in now , is not the real world , 
actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .
 a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out ,
 when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .
 he does so , and finds out that
 he can do anything , be anything
 he wants to be .
 but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy ,
 who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .
 laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .
 but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering
 where all the special effects were .
 yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .
 the trailer for this movie was really decieving
 making people think that
 this was a special effects laden movie .
 now for the second half ,
 it is explosive , and saves the movie .
 some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .
 the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective ,
 and the last hour kept us entertained .
 but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes ,
 this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .
 one would have wished for a better 'matrix' ,
 but i do have to say ,
 i did like it and
 i was entertained .

national lampoon's animal house , made in 1978 and set in 1962 , remains one of the -- no , fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made . 
and this isn't just my opinion , either ;
 everybody knows this ,
 and that's why 
about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made ,
 trying to duplicate its success .
 ( pcu anyone ?
 and the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked . )
 animal house takes place at the fictional faber college , circa 1962 ,
 where the omega frat calls the shots .
 these guys are wholesome , clean-cut , model-citizens . . . i . e . a bunch of assholes .
 greg , their leader , is going out with mandy pepperidge ,
 but since the silly bastard doesn't believe in pre-marital sex ,
 their relationship never goes further than a quick jack-off under the stars . 
neidermeyer is the supreme-bozo of the bunch , walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff .
 also hanging around these losers is babs , future universal studios employee and serious bitch .
 now let's just take a peak next door , at the delta house .
 over here , anything goes :
 you wanna throw shit out the window ? 
okay .
 you wanna crush a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey-mustard all over your chest ?
 go right ahead .
 the frat's leaders are otter and boon ( tim matheson and peter riegert ) .
 otter is the ladies' man , going out with another girl every night ,
 and boon is the comedian .
 he's got a steady-date , katy ( karen allen ) ,
 but she's sick of playing second-fiddle to a bottle of j . d .
 then there are the others :
pinto , a wimp ; flounder , a blimp ; d . day , a biker ; stork , who may or may not have brain-damage ; and last but not least . . . bluto !
 bluto , played by the late , great john belushi , is the man .
 he's the kind of guy 
who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then proclaim , " i needed that . "
 the kind of guy 
who puts a cream-filled snowball into his mouth , puffs up his cheeks and spits it out , and then says " i'm a zit -- get it ? "
the story is as follows : 
the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus .
 the deltas , knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid , decide to go out with style , throwing a wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade .
this is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world .
 do yourself a favor and go see it .

every year , hollywood crowns a new " it boy " --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom .
 inheriting the mantle from last year's " winner , " matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and ,
 like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face ,
 as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting .
 damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--
in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker .
 damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor ,
 who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company .
 while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case ,
 he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) .
 written for the screen and directed by coppola ,
 the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because
 it does not take itself too seriously .
 coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself ,
 which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) .
 the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous ,
 but danes is as superb as always .
 then , of course , there is damon ,
 who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat .
 as good as he is in the rainmaker ,
 damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting ,
 directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself .
 damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit
 who also happens to be a supergenius .
 in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction ,
 an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life .
 good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise
 its plot synopsis suggests ,
 but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount
 the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches .
 even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence ,
 the insecurities he suffers are universal .
 the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors .
 williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ;
 affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ;
 and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest .
 the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon ,
 who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that
 it is hard _not_ to care for him .
 so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine ,
 but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting ,
 it is a safe bet that
 matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come .

synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man
 who killed his wife .
 leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ;
 to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition 
which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that
 leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier .
 because of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes
 he leaves for himself .
 " memento " traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination .
review : " memento " is the sort of movie
 i wish i'd written ;
 i can think of no higher praise than that .
 i am envious that
 nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this .
 an instant film noir classic , " memento " is virtually flawless .
 the script is unlike any
 i have ever seen -- 
a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity .
 although the idea of starting at the " conclusion " of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the " start " is not entirely new ,
 never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence .
 " memento " is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story
 which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre .
 and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ;
 there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively .
 nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite " memento " 's challenging gimmick .
 and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion .
 pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ;
 moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; 
and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality .
 " memento " may be the year's best screenplay , and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 .

earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when
 india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil
 that engulfed the subcontinent .
 people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict ,
 as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee .
 the story takes place in lahore ,
 which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward ,
 regardless of what its citizens might call themselves .
 the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but
 it is really about her nanny , shanta .
 shanta has a small circle of male admirers .
 two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim .
 the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ;
 some are married ;
 but all appreciate shanta ,
 who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .
 ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy
 which will conclude with water . )
 in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ;
 political tension in the country is growing as
 the day of independence nears .
 one of the men remarks , jokingly , that
 their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where
 the different religions can still get along .
 he is wrong :
 the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism .
 the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as
 the movie progresses . 
it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory
 which ends in mass violence and slaughter .
 the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india ,
 and shanta herself the ideal motherland--
one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together .
 but the circle around shanta is sundered ,
 as is the state .
 a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees .
 another man is murdered .
 the group of friends will not meet again .
 the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child ,
 and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles .
 it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country
 which is being destroyed just as painfully .
 the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz .
 his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , 
because they are muslim .
 dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that
 she marry him .
 but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer .
 the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him ,
 and it is easy to see how 
he is seduced by the growing mob mentality :
 the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate .
 despite the things he later does ,
 it is to the credit of earth that
 it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how
 circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things .
 the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt .
 the story earth tells does not end .
 it just stops .
 it is an appropriate finish :
 giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction .
 but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--
they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades .
 since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation ,
 it is only right that
 those dramas should have no terminus .
 there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) .
 earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie .
 it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas .
 but deepa mehta's directon is assured ,
 and the issues she addresses run deep .
 earth does for india what
 movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china :
 they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people
 who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history .
 such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed . 
they may be biased or inaccurate ,
 but they bear the weight of human hardship ,
 and this confers on them a nobility and gravity 
which other , more inventive films , often lack .
 it is notable that
 all three movies were banned in their native countries :
 the events shown may have happened decades ago ,
 but they still touch a nerve .
 the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings
 that took place last year .
 in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other .
 at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons
 why this might happen ; 
after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding .

up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those " look who's talking " movies
 ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout
 ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .
 but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction
 and his career soared once again .
 weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again ,
 while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size isn't everything "
 ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) .
 but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again ,
 and i think we all know why .
 four words : contract with the devil .
 and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's " contract with america . "
 no , satan is much more humane .
 anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .
 how do i know ?
 i own the document in question .
 amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars ,
 isn't it ? 
get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction ,
 with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .
 he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out
 he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .
 sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood ,
 but i guess
 that's beside the point .
 palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made ,
 so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) ,
 who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .
 it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that
 she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial ,
 which has been used in every comedy from " who's the boss ? " to speechless .
 it works in this case , unlike " who's the boss ? "
 although it's interesting to note that 
tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .
 complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters
 who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too ,
 along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .
 get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities .
 this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
 but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies
 i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) .
 get shorty is my kind of movie , one 
that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .
 i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel
 it was based on .
 are you getting this , shorty ?

i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory .
 this was , of course , a big deal for me because 
reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and
 i never get a chance at something like this .
 not only did i get to see an advance screening ,
 i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie .
 the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city .
 gibson's performance is terrific ,
 and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .
 gibson again teams up with richard donner ,
 as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick ,
 and this time around , the combination works even better .
 the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique .
 try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle
 who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups .
 if you can imagine that ,
 then you've basically got jerry fletcher .
 in many ways , i was surprised by this movie .
 to begin with , i was surprised at
 how good it was .
 don't get me wrong ,
 it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring ,
 but it was a very enjoyable movie .
 secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance .
 he provided a fantastic performance .
 the previews of this film led me to believe
 it was an all-out action flick , 
which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense .
 gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations ,
 and his character is one
 that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .
 for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable .
 and last , i was surprised at 
how good the plot is .
 writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story ,
 and when watching this film ,
 you are left to wonder if
 all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions .
 mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film .
 julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee 
who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher ,
 who continually visits alice in hopes that
 she will do something about his theories .
 he also seems obsessed and in love with her .
 but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories ,
 she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that
 one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him .
 jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory ,
 which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) .
 although he only has five subscribers ,
 he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition .
 very soon after he does so ,
 he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man
 who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) .
 after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton .
 the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense ,
 with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy .
 and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life .
 many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience .
 for instance , the meaning of the book " the catcher in the rye " and its ties to assassins ,
 the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead .
 make sure listen closely throughout the film ,
 as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above .
 definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th ,
 make sure you are standing in line to see it .
 i am nearly positive
 everyone should enjoy this film ,
 especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .
 and even if you aren't ,
 you should still like this film .

the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that
 it's hard to remember 
which one you're watching at any given moment .
 " mulan , " their 36th animated adventure , is the latest case in point .
 once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel , belle , pocahontas , and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) .
 add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two ,
 pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage-backed crowd pleaser ) ,
 pose a few threats to our engaging lead ,
 and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits .
 bob's your uncle !
 better make that walt's your uncle . . .
 kids will no doubt go ga-ga over " mulan " ( or at least the fast food tie-ins ) ,
 but familiarity can , after a while , leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more .
 maybe an animated feature without--shock ! horror ! --the songs , for example ?
 or maybe a film in which
 a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ?
 how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ?
 it isn't gonna happen .
 like disney's previous entries , " mulan " is slow to make its mark .
 the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going
 and the humorous element , a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth , courtesy eddie murphy's animated vocal talents ) , plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought .
however , after about an hour everything comes together and
 the formula , like it or not , clicks .
 highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass 
( which , due to the sophistication of today's computer-generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) ,
 a memorable , show-stopping musical interlude ( " i'll make a man out of you , " penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself .
 voiced by ming-na wen , mulan is disney's strongest female character to date .
 when hordes of huns pour over china's great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace ,
 the emperor decrees that
 every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army .
 since mulan's father is infirm , but proud , the high-spirited
 mulan steals her father's armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace .
 attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang (b . d . wong ) ,
 mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability .
 she's a woman of the '90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time .

i had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister .
 twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with .
 but twister had amazing effects and
 i was hoping
 so would volcano
 volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo .
 he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter .
 there is one small quake then another quake .
 then a geologist points out to tommy that
 its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours .
 a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall .
 then . . . . it starts .
 the volcanic eruption . . . .
 i liked this movie . . .
 but it was not as great
 as i hoped .
 i was still good none the less .
 it had excellent special effects .
 the best view . . . the helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos .
 also . . . there were interesting side stories
 that made the plot more interesting .
 so . . . it was good ! !

disney's 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with , well , the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center .
 great wit , great art , and a great villain ( james woods as hades , lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) can't quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero , his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil ) , and a largely unremarkable soundtrack .
 ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy .
 some lack lyrical snap .
 others need more memorable melodies .
 boring ballads we expect , but boring production numbers , too ? )
 so , hercules is a bit of a long sit ,
 but you won't stay bored .
 the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra ) , a steady stream of anachronisms ( " somebody call ix-i-i " ) and pop references ( " let's get ready to rumble ! " ) a la aladdin , and several long-overdue jabs at the mouse's marketing and merchandising depart- ments .
 while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it's a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas .
 directed by ron clements and john musker , with voice credits including tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as lighting bolt zeus , rip torn ,
 who's having a very good summer , also appearing in trial and error and men in black .

the computer-animated comedy " shrek " is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups .
 for children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs 
( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances ,
 apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) .
 for adults , it's a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes
 that will sail over the heads of the kids .
 all in all , " shrek " is a snappy ride ,
 although there are a couple of points i found disturbing .
 but first the basics .
 based very loosely on a 1990 children's story ,
 " shrek " follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers 
in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using .
 shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp ,
 until a local nobleman disturbs his peace .
 petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the " awk " in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land
 on which shrek resides .
 he proceeds to turn the ogre's yard into an ellis island for storybook characters 
when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle .
 as a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few .
 an enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain .
 lord obnoxious wants to become king and
 the magic mirror from " snow white " has shown him the way .
 all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife .
 the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of " the dating game " 
( when snow white is shown ,
 the cheeky announcer purrs , " even though she lives with seven men , she's not easy ! " )
 farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal :
 if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne ,
 the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds .
 shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend .
 they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn
 she is not the helpless maiden
 they expected to meet .
 for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well .
 the movie references a great many other flicks , from " babe " ( " that'll do , donkey . that'll do " ) to " the graduate . "
 but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney .
 the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ?
 pinocchio is referred to as a " possessed toy " and 
when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin ,
 he bellows , " get that dead broad off the table ! " ?
 but the biggest slams come when
 shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile ,
 which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures
 that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune
 that sounds a lot like " it's a small world . "
 which brings me to disturbing point number one .
 i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad .
 the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known .
 for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day .
 and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer .
 here's a suggestion for the two boys :
 grow up !
 put the past behind you !
 there's room in the sandbox for both of you
 and if you farquaads can't play nice ,
 then go to your rooms !
 the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad .
 beyond all the irreverence , " shrek " actually has a message :
 people should learn to look beyond physical appearances ,
 because true beauty lies within .
 it's a lovely notion ,
 but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature .
 do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that
 mocking short people is acceptable ?
 the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers .
 adding short jokes is simply mean .
 still , " shrek " is a rollicking good time .
 the computer animation is mostly impressive 
( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys
 and the human movements are often jerky ) ,
 the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) ,
 the laughs come fast and furious ,
 and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one .
 to trot out a clich ? ,
 " shrek " is fun for all ages .
parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that
 taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .

after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film ,
 you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .
 there is a scene where
 an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles ,
 as a master would teach an eager apprentice .
 " you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , " he says ,
 " then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' "
 of course , it's meant to be a parody ,
 but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness 
that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .
 you begin to appreciate the food 
as not merely something you eat ,
 not something you like ,
 not something you enjoy ,
 but rather something you experience .
 experiencing it is a process
 which engages all of the senses , 
fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that
 the total is a pleasure
 that is more than the sum of its parts .
 trust me ,
 you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .
 juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront
 by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan .
 a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) ,
 the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .
 goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious .
 goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop
 that people would flock to from far away ,
 just to eat a bowl of her ramen .
 the problem is ,
 her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing .
 however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest ,
 and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy .
 this film is filled with many little scenes
 which are absolute gems .
 take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .
 the price is too high ,
 but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .
 tampopo meets him at his store late at night ,
 and he leads her to a back room .
 she protests , thinking that
 perhaps this man has ulterior motives ,
 but he insists .
 just when she is about to bolt for the exit ,
 he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .
 she peers through and takes notes as
 she watches the cook make the soup for the next day ,
 her face filled with a joy 
that can be felt by the audience .
 this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery .
 there's also an interesting scene
 where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people
 who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers .
 we even watch as
 one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .
 the scene is meant to bring a laugh ,
 but it also says that 
no matter whether people are rich or poor ,
 food is something which
 everyone has in common ,
 and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .
 there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film ,
 which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives .
 a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .
 surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life .
 her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that
 she get up and make dinner .
 the viewer knows
 the husband's intention is not to be mean ;
 he is desperate for the normalcy of which
 he and his family has obviously been deprived ,
 and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .
 in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family .
 as the family eats ,
 she looks on them and smiles .
 preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her ,
 and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy .
 then she falls over , dead .
 for a moment , the family is stunned ,
 but then the father yells at the children , " keep eating ! this is the last meal your mother ever made ! "
 crying as they do so ,
 the family finishes the meal .
 the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful .
 by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film ,
but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .
 instead , they even help contribute to the idea that
 tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .
 because the film parodies a western ,
 the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable 
as we watch the familiar way in which
 the " good guys " come together for the final showdown .
 in this case , the showdown is against the ramen .
 if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all ,
 tampopo knows 
she has succeeded .
 it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be ,
 but when a film changes your whole perspective on
 something you consume every day of your life ,
 you can afford to cut it a little slack .

there's an old saying 
that states something about 
leaving the best for last .
 george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .
 return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .
 the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .
 instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .
 even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around .
 with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .
 return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .
 luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine .
 their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .
 it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts ,
 that most of the added special effects come into play .
 from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge ,
 the effects are top notch .
 as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt ,
 it's back to outer space ,
 where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat :
a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone 
who stands against the emperor .
 so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle ,
 luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield
 that defends the death star against all attacks .
 there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race ,
 and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .
 return of the jedi has some interesting elements .
 the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .
 from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .
 not only are there many , many more ships ,
 but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .
 on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .
 in the special edition , even more ships are added , 
making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .
 the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .
 by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .
 the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .
 as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .
 newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature ,
 although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .
 although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen ,
 return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .
 with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .
 congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . ,

why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? 
too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that
 the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .
 " the iron giant , " which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as " the simpsons " and " king of the hill , " assumes that
 not only can children handle such discussions ,
 but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .
 " the iron giant " holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience ,
 making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .
 hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad
 who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .
 after staying up late and watching scary movies
 on a night his mother is away ,
 hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate
 what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .
 he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space
 that eats metal for food .
 after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock ,
 hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .
 because of damage he suffered upon landing ,
 the giant has forgotten 
what his original mission was ,
 so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .
 realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that
 the giant needs food ,
 he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist
 who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . 
it soon becomes apparent that
 dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever ,
 because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .
 he suspects
 hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .
 meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior 
that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .
 " the iron giant " is exactly what family films ought to be ,
 because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .
 the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being
 that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .
 it's very similar to the spielberg classic " e . t . , "
 and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of " the iron giant . "
 the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .
 the film delivers several serious messages ,
 the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .
 hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what
 he wants to be : a hero .
 the final sequence is touching and appropriate ,
 though i won't give it away ,
 i will say that
 very few will be disappointed .
 the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after " tarzan " ? ) , is good enough to make you forget
 you're watching a cartoon .
 the giant is computer-animated ,
 while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .
 the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible ,
 but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions 
that provide for comic relief .
 fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth ,
 and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .
 harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean ,
 and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's " frasier " ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .
 unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick
 ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .
 dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems to suggest that ) ,
 but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .
 even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain 
who does bad things simply because
 he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .
 a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind ,
 but " the iron giant " has clearly put a little work into making the characters real ,
 and it pays off .
 the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .
 it's also very funny ,
 and the humor is of the kind
 that both children and adults will enjoy .
 the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well ,
 and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on " the simpsons " for many years .
 a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to " outlast " one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .
 the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war ,
 satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students 
that tell them to " duck and cover " in the event of a nuclear attack .
 " the iron giant " has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films ,
 and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .
 instead of seeing people get bonked on the head ,
 we get well-timed , clever gags
 that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .
 when you get right down to it ,
 " the iron giant " is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .
 the story is so straightforward , so quaint ,
 that it ultimately becomes charming .
 though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person ,
 when it comes to family entertainment ,
 simple is the way to go .
 it's akin to one of those bedtime stories
 your father told 
that had you hanging on his every word ,
 but it's not the story
 that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements
 that go into the story ,
 namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue ,
 which " the iron giant " has in spades .

susan granger's review of " the closet " ( miramax films )
 in this hilarious french farce ,
 a shy , boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers
 he's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory .
 lonely and distraught , he contemplates suicide .
 but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont ) , an elderly homosexual neighbor ,
 who suggests a " sex discrimination " lawsuit to intimidate management .
 as evidence , belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon's boss .
 when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory ,
 not only does pignon get his job back but
 he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man .
 his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that 
she wonders if , perhaps ,
 she could change his sexual preferences .
 even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain .
 but not everyone is enchanted .
 a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu ) , a self-righteous homophobe , is stunned and repulsed when
 he's forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignon's friendship or risk losing his own job .
 writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as
 he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness , veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia .
 daniel auteuil ( " the widow of saint-pierre " ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head , riding on a float in a gay pride parade -
 and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained , and effective , performances .
 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , 
" the closet " is a frankly sexual , adult 8 .
 it's so clever , in fact , that
 hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english , like " la cage aux folles . "

roman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor .
 however the emperor's evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father 
before the announcement can be made ,
 and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed .
 maximus is able to escape his executioners , but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) .
 proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money 
( he being a former gladiator himself ) ,
 and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator .
 when emperor commodus announces that
 new games will be held in the colisseum ,
 proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle .
 maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus .
 gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania , and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required " 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence " style of moviemaking .
 the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . .
 it's choppy slow-motion
 which is unsettling and distracting .
 it's similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan , but nowhere near as effective .
 the actual gladiator battles are thrilling , but also a bit disjointed .
 many times it's unclear as to exactly
 what's going on . . .
 all the audience can tell is that
 blood is being spilled .
 we're not sure who's blood or by who's hand though .
 there's an instance of this earlier in the film too that's disappointing .
 it's comes when
 maximus escapes his executioners .
 some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . .
 but i still don't know exactly
 how he did it .
 russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995's virtuosity .
 for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . .
 but he should have it now .
 from here on moviegoers should now be able to say ,
 " let's go see the new russell crowe movie " .
 he gets the best scene in the film 
( and one of the best moments of all recent movies )
 when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum .
 it's both rousing and chilling .
 joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character
 ( which could have easily happened ) .
 commodus is conniving , sneaky and whiny ,
 but phoenix never lets the character get silly .
 it's a very good ( and very creepy ) performance .
 oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator ,
 and it's a huge loss to the acting world .
 i've always been fascinated with reed . . .
 he's one of those very talented performers 
who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years .
 it's ironic that 
this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again ,
 as he gives a fun and sincere performance .
 the film is dedicated to him ,
 and he will surely be missed .
 reed's death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem ,
 as he still had scenes to be completed .
 rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage ) ,
 a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars .
 ironically , that was probably more money than
 reed ever earned for a single film .
 anyway , this digital effect is only used in one scene 
that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and
 if you aren't looking for it
 you won't even be able to tell . 
some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . .
 and like i always say ,
 noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately .
 it's sad that 
such a good film has these distractions .
 movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects .
 keep in mind that
 gladiator is based on real people and real events , but is entirely a work of fiction .
 however it's a work of fiction 
that's great entertainment ,
 and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d .

what a great film .
 what a stunning , touching , heart-wrenching , heart-warming , life-affirming , miraculous film .
from its opening moments , _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy .
 a car with no brakes speeds through the town , 
and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way .
 they mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day .
 heil !
 heil ! 
huh ?
 shortly thereafter , the president drives through ,
 and people stare , with blank faces .
 this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff :
 the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society 
in which he = lives .
 granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece .
 i think
 lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point :
 chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax ,
 but to do so , he had to break completely from character .
 benigni is given a similar situation :
 he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how
 scientists have concluded that
 aryans are the superior race .
 benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept .
 it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema .
 there are many other scenes , especially in the first half ,
 which are bright and loopy and funny and silly .
 slapstick reigns ,
 and although the film is subtitled ,
 there was no doubt that
 a universal language was being conveyed .
 and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) ,
 a silent undercurrent creeps in .
 this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others ,
 and it will soon affect him and = his family .
 the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp ,
 where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported .
 guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child .
 for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that
 he is all right .
 for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that
 this is all one big elaborate game :
 it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds .
 which raises the big questions :
 how do we deal with pain ?
 with persecution ?
 with injustice on the worst level ?
 it+s said that
 tragedies bring out the best in people ,
 finding strengths they did not realize
 they had .
 other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim .
 sometimes even , people giggle in these moments ,
 as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds .
 benigni+s guido realizes this .
 he is the clown ,
 but he is not a fool .
 he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks ,
 he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh .
 his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him .
 it+s obvious from the onset that
 here is someone
 who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor .
 perhaps that is a form of denial .
 perhaps his alternate reality is all that
 he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) .
 or . . . perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit .
 whatever his purposes is subject to debate ,
 but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept .
 surprisingly , it works .
 it is an important footnote that
 this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust .
 it+s not that 
the atrocities are trivialized , far from it . 
they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--
less is more .
 i believe = that
 benigni was cautious to preserve the tone ,
 and i like the theory that = 
it is guido+s alternate reality 
that we+re seeing .
 however , any criticism that this is rewriting history , 
that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target . 
benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) .
 he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society .
 it swept the italian academy awards .
 controversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film .
 masterful .
 miraculous .
 a must-see .

ingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood 
synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel .
 in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham's snobbish adopted daughter , estella .
 the gist of the story is that
 an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class " gentleman . "
 pip leaves for london with " great expectations " to be groomed into a gentleman so that
 he can one day be classy enough to marry estella .
 but life has a way of complicating things .
 pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b . 
until he learns just
 who his secret benefactor is .
 in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) .
 but soon the focus of finn's life becomes romance ,
 as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment .
 estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man-hating single aunt
 whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage .
 this causes estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships ,
 but finn thinks
 it's just a case of snobbery .
 when finn becomes a young man , 
an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist .
 finn leaves florida with " great expectations " to be a successful artist so that
 some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella .
 what will happen to all of finn's " great expectations ? "
 opinion : if you're looking for a romance with a happy ending ,
 look no further ;
 you've found one here .
 ethan hawke is romantic lead .
 ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites .
 he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise .
 he romanced uma thurman in gattaca .
 now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . )
 hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film .
 meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ;
 estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate .
 anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor ,
 while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably .
 the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that 
the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love ,
 whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .

you've seen this moment before , recently :
 a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when
 the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .
 the difference is that
 when it happens to lili taylor's nell in the haunting ,
 we don't care .
 the hero of the sixth sense , a young boy named cole , is a rich creation ,
 and we wish nothing more than for
 the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .
 the seasons have changed since
 an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .
 desperate to get his career back on track , even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams , of rushmore ) , malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .
 the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm's would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .
 only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) 
does he divulge to malcolm , in a spine-tingling scene , that
 he sees dead people walking among us , all the time .
 malcolm assumes , and given his profession , reasonably so ,
 that cole is schizophrenic , not psychic ,
 but the sincerity in cole's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .
 he will instead pursue the supernatural angle , becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother , lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .
 the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .
 ( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )
 it's far more heartwarming than frightening ,
 and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .
 cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , 
but they're not out to harm him , really-
they just want to be heard ,
 even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .
 perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than
 they really are because 
we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old .
 that's right :
 willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .
 we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma ,
 but we identify with cole ,
 recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .
 both actors deliver immensely likable performances , 
and their dynamic is manifest .
 willis convinces us that
 he's a doctor ,
 something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .
 osment is phenomenal , a true professional
 who resists mugging for the camera like
 some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .
 the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-
its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .
 only because i was expecting something different
 did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time ,
 which is just shy of two hours .
 the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ;
 its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .
i'm not sure
 said big twist ending is bulletproof ,
 but i admired its audacity .

hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death
 ( no pun intended - honest ) .
 it's a shame , too ,
 because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .
 i mean , come on .
 are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein
 that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?
 hell no .
 and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell ,
 but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films .
 and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either .
 this is precisely why
 it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .
 i got to go back to the times when
 making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays .
 and that is exactly what
 this film is ; art .
 i've been a horror fan since
 i was eight years old ,
 and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that
 this film covers .
 let me backtrack a minute .
 when i say " intellectual ground " ,
 i don't mean that
 nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that ,
 i just mean that
 in order for the film to work the way
 it was intended to ,
 a little bit of thinking is involved .
 with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore
 that is shown .
 those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ;
 movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder
 what is happening on the screen .
 you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .
 this is a thinking man's slasher flick .
 the " nosferatu " of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count
 that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy .
 he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect )
 who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .
 upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home 
( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) .
 the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . 
not really a good sign .
 he then discovers through some reading that
 the count is a " nosferatu " , or vampire , one of the undead
 that feeds off the blood of living humans .
 but by the time he pieces this together ,
 he is too late ;
 orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat .
 will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?
 the character of orlock is , of course , dracula .
 the only only reason his name was changed was because
 this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel .
 just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .
 probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores .
 however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece .
 the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis .
 now , i really appreciate what
 arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience
 that might have otherwise just skipped this one .
 but alas , i like watching movies the way 
they were originally intended to be seen .
 but that's just my bag ;
 you may like the newer , more " modern " version better .
 either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy .
 if you like what
 they have done with it ,
 pop it in the vcr and enjoy .
 if you're like me ,
 just do what i'll do during future viewings ;
 turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view
 what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .

stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder .
 grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento .
 boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone ,
 the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento .
 it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's .
 based on the novel by graziella magherini ,
 the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer . 
visiting florence to follow up several leads ,
 she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt 
where he hopes to identify 
exactly who is on his tail .
 at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints .
 posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer ,
 a strange game of cat and mouse begins .
 a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too ,
 which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives .
 the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario .
 it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration .
 the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers .
 but as dark as its themes are ,
 the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years .
 argento is once again working in his native italy ,
 and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences.
 effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here ,
 and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent .
 the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style .
 proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers .
 the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english
 that renders speech all but emotionless .
 asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating .
 it's a difficult role ,
 and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts .
 thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo ,
 and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest .
 but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack .
 active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career 
and this must rate as one of his finest efforts .
 it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty
 that lingers long afterwards .
 it's been three decades since
 argento and morricone worked together .
 this is a long welcome reunion .
 if the film has a fault ,
 it is that
 the last half hour drags a little and
 the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax .
 but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career .
 * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .
 dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .

close your eyes for a moment ,
 if you will ,
 and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness .
 a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols .
 an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' " a clockwork orange . "
 a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile , like those out of " delicatessen , " or " the tin drum . "
 imagine all of that ,
 and you'll get a good sense of
 what you can expect from " the butcher boy . "
 imagine that and more .
 neil jordan's latest film " stars " rea in more ways than one .
 rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's " the crying game , " contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s .
 but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis ,
 that makes rea's " performance " worth watching , worth listening to .
 and that's only half the fun .
 playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and
 he is , without a doubt , a revelation .
 for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of " the butcher boy , "
 owens commands virtually every frame .
 it's impossible to take your eyes off him .
 with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .
 in fact , everything was ok 
until " the nugent " came to town .
 now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace
 ( " the butcher boy " is set at a time when
 the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) .
 " pigs ! " screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie .
 " you're all pigs ! " 
it's the start of many a related image .
 after ma brady is shipped off to the " garage " for psychiatric observation and
 da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many ,
 francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters .
 squealing like a stuck pig , francie does " the likes o' that " on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for " boney arsed bogmen , "
 where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over .
 director jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches
 ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) .
 it's not as outlandish as
 the trailers make out ;
 instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior .
 it's bleak and
 it's black but
 it's fundamentally very funny .
 rea talks us through it , beautifully ,
 and owens drags us though it , admirably , and ,
 in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make " the butcher boy " a film worth savoring .

zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) ,
 although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .
 zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator
 who ever lived 
( at least he'd like to think so ) .
 however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way --
 this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than
 they already are .
 zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a " normal " guy
 who does the business side of the job --
 he's the one 
who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator .
 the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) .
 it turns out that
 stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that
 he apparently knows nothing about .
 zero takes the case ,
 and the plot thickens .
 his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .
 despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be
 the one blackmailing stark .
 through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria --
 feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .
 i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .
 i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and ,
 every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long 
that blows me away 
( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) .
 zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator
 that succeeds in all attempts :
 it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .
 with so many cliches available to this genre ,
 i find it amazing 
that kasdan avoided all of them .
 but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws :
 he has created a great film here ,
 one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .
 take , for starters , the great cast of characters .
 pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that
 i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs .
 zero is the kind of guy
 who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as
 he does here ;
 the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .
 pullman's performance is much more layered
 than it might seem at first glance ,
 and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious .
 ben stiller is also a very funny individual ;
he's the kind of comedian
 who makes normal lines sound funny .
 " i'll shoot you , " he says to stark at one point .
 " i have a gun , and everything . "
 his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone )
 who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time
 he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .
 o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ;
 and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism 
this kind of character really needs .
 i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .
 kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven
 ( though there are some great visual jokes ) .
 it's the kind of humor 
that's funny even after 
you've seen it five or six times .
 there's one scene in which
 zero talks about 
how detached he is , 
an how that makes him such a great detective .
 what we see during this narration are various shots of
 him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .
 i can't convey to you 
how funny this is ,
 but what makes it great film making is that
 it has a point --
 scenes like this are frequent ,
 and they provide solid characterization of zero .
 as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer
 when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) --
 i find things funny that
 many do not , and vice versa .
 there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film ,
 and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .
 i have a feeling 
the humor here won't appeal to everyone ,
 but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest .
 jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .
 i found this out after seeing the film ,
 and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .
 his direction is stylish without being pretentious ,
 and his writing is mature , full , and developed .
 zero effect is the kind of film that
 i'll buy for my collection --
 smart , original films like this are rare
 as it is ,
 but this one actually has a heart and a soul .
 at the end of the film ,
 i was involved in the characters ,
 and i was satisfied with the outcome .
 and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age ,
 all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .

the long kiss goodnight ( r )
 meryl streep tried it and failed .
 even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets .
 however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight ,
 a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin .
 davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother
 whose memories only go back eight years .
 with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) ,
 she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative .
 needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .
 shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ;
 i'm not so sure if
 his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag ,
 but for what it's worth ,
 it delivers the goods .
 like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue .
 the humor especially works well in this case ,
 for the story is so preposterous 
that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .
 but there's no argument that
 the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell :
 who can resist the sight of 
davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . . while ice skating ? 
jackson and davis make a good team .
 jackson is funny as ever as ever ;
 in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .
 as good as he is ,
 the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis ,
 who shows much promise as an action heroine .
 what makes her so effective and
 why she should succeed
 where streep and lee failed is that
 she doesn't take herself too seriously .
 she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .
 this is not to say that
 she doesn't need work--
sometimes she lays on the " toughness " a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .
 but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female ,
 davis could have found her special niche .
 it seems as if 
davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss ,
 in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .
 anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .

screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .
 screenplay by andrew kevin walker .
 inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .
 directed by tim burton .
 starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .
 special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .
 synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .
 townspeople believe
 the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .
 cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .
 comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .
 batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .
 he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .
 sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .
 sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .
 christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge
 who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .
 the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .
 one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .
 i mention these allusions for a reason .
 seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .
 with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) ,
 we needed a film like this .
 not only does it have a sense of history ,
 but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .
 the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .
 johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane ,
 who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator .
 depp is adequate in his role .
 no more ; no less .
 equally adequate is christina ricci ,
 who plays the love interest in the film .
 she's a good witch too .
 how cute .
 one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .
 the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough ,
 but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .
 veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy
 which depp uncovers .
 while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points ,
 i can say that 
the storyline becomes quite confusing .
 you have to pay attention .
 andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .
 he's the one
 who also wrote 8 mm and seven .
 walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood ,
 and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation .
 as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker ,
 sleepy hollow is quite graphic .
 there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .
 this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .
 a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand .
 he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence .
 if you're looking for a good scare , however ,
 sleepy hollow is definately recommended .

mpaa : not rated 
( though i feel
 it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . )
 with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest " hot properties " in action adventure stardom ,
 and it's just about time .
 for over twenty-five years , jackie's been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy .
 " drunken master " has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to " make it big " --
this is the movie
 that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .
 i'm not entirely sure why , exactly .
 in many ways , " drunken master " is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii , " master with cracked fingers " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , " spiritual kung fu " , and others .
 in fact , looking at all these early films together ,
 one gets the impression that
 they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year ,
 all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .
 to be honest , i think that
 early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .
 they're quite different from action movies
 as we know them in america .
 these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots
 that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .
 " drunken master " , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception .
 ( as an aside , " drunken master " was the first jackie chan movie
 i ever saw ,
 and i saw it the way
 it was meant to be seen . . . in a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival .
 at the time , i didn't really think
 it was anything special . . .
 but after having seen more films like it ,
 it's kind of grown on me . )
 " drunken master " 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as " fearless hyena " i and ii and " master with cracked fingers " --
slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end
 ( a formula that has been " adapted , " to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) .
 more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka " naughty panther , " a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student 
who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough .
 after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , 
then beating up a bully in a marketplace ,
 wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that
 she , and her mother , can hit back ,
 better than he can . . . and is further chagrinned to discover that
 the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively .
 his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when
 the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .
 kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment ,
 which fei-hong does not like at all .
 while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man ,
 who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .
 this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .
 he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises ,
 that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .
 then , when he's ready ,
 he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .
 unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .
 " drunken master " features some wonderful martial arts sequences ,
 with jackie winning some fights and losing others .
 it's been said before ,
 but i'll say it again--
these fights don't just _happen_ ,
 they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance ,
 and it shows .
 in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .
 the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films .
 whether jackie wins or loses ,
 it's really something to see . . .
 and it's often as funny as anything , too .
 and funny is the other thing 
jackie chan is very , very good at .
 there's very little 
that's new in this movie--
jackie winning fights , 
jackie getting beaten badly by a master ,
 jackie going through punishment or training . . .
 these schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .
 but they're still hilarious as ever .
 likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast ,
 many of whom were also in other early jackie films ,
 and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .
 the really big thing about " drunken master " , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu .
 i'm not certain whether or not
 this is actually a genuine style of kung fu ,
 but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . .
 and it apparently helps if
 you're drunk while
 you're doing it .
 genuine or not , i have to admit , 
there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow 
who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them
 before they even realize
 what's going on .
 come to think of it ,
 perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . .
 it's not just martial arts ,
 it's the kind of martial arts 
that makes you stop and go , " whoa . . . "
 on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special ,
 the film stock is rather primitive ,
 the plot is often rather slow ,
 and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .
 " gone with the wind " , this isn't .
 still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more ,
 give it a shot .
 it's much more " real " than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .
 you might very well like it .
 another interesting thing about " drunken master " has to do with its video availability in the us .
 " drunken master " is the only early jackie chan movie
 that i know of
 that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) .
 there are plenty of other early jackie films around ,
 but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .
 thankfully , " drunken master " , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price .
 if you like " drunken master " ,
 take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films
 that are out there 
( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . .
 if nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .
 i particularly recommend " spiritual kung fu " , " half a loaf of kung fu " , the " fearless hyena " movies , and " snake &amp; crane arts of shaolin " .
 also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , " drunken master ii " , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year
 ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .
 also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) ,
 i've been told to suggest the " once upon a time in china " series starring jet li
 ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) .
 if you choose to watch " drunken master " ,
 i really hope
 you enjoy it ,
 and i hope
 it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema
 that's out there .
 all in all , i give this film an .

well , i know that
 stallone is 50 years old now ,
 but in daylight he doesn't look it !
 daylight is a great disaster movie .
 if you've seen cliffhanger ,
 you'll know stallone's character already .
 a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time .
 a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses
 when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste .
 a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball
 ( and what a fire ball it was ! )
 stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around ,
 when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion .
 then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! 
from here on , the plot takes a back seat ,
 and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged .
 most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat .
 there are a few melodramatic parts here ,
 but , they tend to work out well .
 there is no general antagonist in this film ,
 but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that .
 daylight is a great film ,
 i saw a non-matinee showing of it ,
 and i thought
 it was worth every penny .
 the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional ,
 but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters .
 rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .

logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility .
 considering that
 the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities ,
 writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task .
 occasionally , we get a film
 that does manage it .
 terry gilliam's " 12 monkeys " was one such film .
 but more frequently , we get films
 that don't much deal with it at all .
 there is one question to ask in this case :
 does the film have other virtues
that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?
 the " terminator " films made up for them with exciting action ,
 " back to the future " did it with an entertaining story ,
 and the new film " frequency " pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own .
 is " frequency " filled with plot holes ?
 yes .
 does it matter ?
 not really .
 the film opens in october of 1969 .
 firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time
 he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) .
 the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 ,
 where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective .
 a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate
 through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and 
that john has found in the present day .
 though both are initially skeptical of the idea ,
 john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire ,
 and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom .
 now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive ,
 john is initially overjoyed ,
 until he discovers that 
the changes to the timeline have been disastrous :
 a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women .
 frank and john now must work together to set things right ,
 with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past .
 the premise of " frequency " is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept :
 john and frank are the only ones conscious of how
 the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions .
 this isn't explained ;
 you just have to go with it .
 when frank doesn't die in a fire ,
 john is the only one 
who remembers it differently ,
 while everyone else remembers it the new way .
 the concept also runs into problems concerning 
just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .
 sometimes frank's changing the past results in 
something happening right away in john's world ,
 and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time .
 now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this ,
 and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical )
 if i thought about it hard enough 
( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because 
the change had already happened in frank's world ,
 and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) ,
 but explanations aren't really the point .
 when " frequency " gets cooking ,
 it's a riveting little thriller ,
 even if it is confusing .
 what matters to a film like this is
 if the plot makes sense in the moment ,
 and " frequency " works as long as
 it keeps moving .
 the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .
 director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure " frequency " as good hollywood entertainment ,
 establishing decent , likable characters ,
 making us care for them ,
 and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved .
 i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward .
 it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect 
-- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome
 to convince his friends to believe him .
 ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . )
 i even liked the final scene ,
 which features 
frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods .
 some may find this scene blindingly confusing ,
 as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious ,
 but it does make sense
 if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) ,
 and let's face it :
 it's a darn cool way to end the film .
 there are enough surprises and plot twists in " frequency " to keep you on your toes ,
 and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant .
 the other major thing to appreciate about " frequency " is the handling of the father-son relationship .
 quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ;
 it's a rock-solid job from both actors .
 the relationship is instantly credible because
 they find the human truth behind the high concept :
 how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ?
 watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of
 how to answer that question .
 the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ;
 if we don't believe in the characters ,
 we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot .
 here , we do care ,
 because we like the lead actors .
 i also liked some of the supporting cast members .
 elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably .
 andre braugher , late of the television show " homicide : life on the street , " gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john .
 he has a lovely scene in a diner
 in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while
 frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes .
 braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused .
 perhaps the only thing i didn't like about " frequency " is the overly sentimental coda , during which
 the camera's focus goes a little too soft and
 the baseball theme gets carried overboard .
 but that's only because 
the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .
 i freely acknowledge that
 " frequency " may best work as a " guy " movie ,
 since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships
 ( echoes of " field of dreams " can be easily heard ) ,
 but the underlying concept is universally applicable .
 who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ?
 or see how their children turn out ? 
" tell me about your life , son " --
 excuse me while i mist up .
 and don't call me a sissy .

blade is the movie
 that shows that
 wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men .
 blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it .
 it is a very stylish movie 
and for the most part that style works very well .
 although , at a few points i thought
 i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie .
 the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story .
 but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled ,
 and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once .
 that really doesn't take away from the story too much ,
 but it does hurt it a little bit .
 blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire .
 his mother was bitten by a vampire when 
she was pregnant with him and as a result
 he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .
 including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum
 which quenches his blood lust .
 blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge 
for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .
 but this isn't as easy as it seems ,
 because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than
 the ones that you find in most films .
 the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires ,
 but they let them feast of the population at large because
 they are taking bribes from the vampires .
 where do vampires get money ?
 well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations .
 i personally thought that
 this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie .
 blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .
 he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that 
the vampire race is the superior one and
 he means to insure its superiority .
 he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls 
that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable . 
it's up to blade to see that
 this doesn't transpire .
 admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through .
 the story is a relatively forgettable one ,
 but it is fun none the less .
 the acting in blade is just about
 what you would expect from a movie of this type .
 this isn't a film 
that is going to win accolades for its performances ,
 and the actors know this .
 the movie is played for fun 
and nobody seems to think otherwise .
 it's a popcorn movie ,
 and no one involved has any illusions otherwise .
 blade's production values are as slick as any 
that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .
 the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .
 although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences .
 blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .
 this is not the movie for those of you
 who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .
 what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .
 very cool .

the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir
 after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen .
 in case you've been asleep for the last few months ,
 the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey )
 who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .
 his life seems so perfect , however ,
 because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show ,
 the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .
 that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public ,
 and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .
 the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .
 with an idea so different ,
 it would be easy for 
the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .
 luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .
 talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career .
 his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona .
 he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly ,
 but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .
 he's not completely dramatic
 like the film promises , however .
 ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show .
 quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer .
 unfortunately , he's barely in the film ,
 and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !
 also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .
 she plays the role well ,
 but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines
 just when the audience is used to her .
 the supporting cast is excellent ,
 and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .
 the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .
 peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .
 the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .
 although it is slightly slow to begin with ,
 about half an hour into film the pace really picks up ,
 and when christoff is introduced fully
 the film is on a roll .
 sadly , though , the film is practically over when
 the film is in full steam .
 also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous ,
 which was disappointing .
 the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .
 while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly ,
 they never go over the line ,
 which would have been easy
 for niccol to do .
 also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people
 who watch the show .
 overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .
 certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces ,
 it should be viewed by everyone .
 it offers something to every member of the audience ,

no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .
 on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story
 because he is such an unsavory character ,
 unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .
 on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans
 because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) .
 on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes
 because some of his , for lack of a better word , " bad " deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee
 in which he performs them .
 however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable ,
 and the film as a whole is unforgettable --
 perhaps because it is so disturbing . 
what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .
 think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs ,
 and you'll sort of understand .
 anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ;
 love francie or hate him ,
 you cannot take your eyes off of owens .
 the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film 
that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .
 in the lobby after the screening ,
 i overheard one man raving about
 how great yet disturbing it was ;
 i also heard 
one particularly offended woman say with disgust ,
 "  that movie was so unfunny ! "
 " i didn't know what to expect . it's like something you chase for so long , but then you don't know how to react when you get it . i still don't know how to react . "

just how inseparable is the team of sgt . martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt . roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ?
 let's just say that
 when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction ,
 his partner actually does it !
 the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo ,
 who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and
 joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant
 who has decided to become a private eye .
 new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective .
 trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives
 where ever they go ,
 and in this film , that is no exception .
 even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride ,
 they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship .
 we here some ominous music ,
 which clues us that 
a confrontation is about to happen .
 gunfire ensues ,
 and when it's all over ,
 the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord .
 although they don't know what they're looking for ,
 their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .
 and there's plenty of action here for two movies .
 led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive ,
he does what he can to make sure that
 no one finds out what they are up to .
 li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives .
 there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore .
 it's a summer action recipe followed to the letter ,
 and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun .
 but even too many explosions can get boring .
 to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li .
 luckily , he'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns .
 meanwhile , when the detectives aren't reloading their guns or running from fireballs ,
 they're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations
 that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .
 everybody gets in on the shtick . 
russo screams during her delivery ,
 the crime lord has a few funny bits
 when he's being interrogated while being given laughing gas ,
 and pesci and rock are very funny as 
they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .
 gibson and glover are always in sync and 
the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano .
 score one for the old guard .

since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .
 now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues ,
 the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .
 this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times ,
 as 1993's schindler's list shows .
 most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting
 that can turn off members of the audience .
 that's why 
pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .
 the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia .
 it's a well-known fact that
 the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones
 that get out of the town on football scholarships ;
 the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .
 the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .
 after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , 
homer feels a connection with the outside world --
 as he puts it , " anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . "
 drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .
 with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers ,
 the four are soon bound for great things .
 october sky is a skillfully crafted film ,
 and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .
 johnston --whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here .
 he molds characters
 which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot
 that is straightforward and robust .
 he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking
 which enhances the film's charm .
 his finesse brings out elements
 which might otherwise be lost --
 such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father .
 the cast is well chosen ,
 although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .
 laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher ,
 giving the boys the support and guidance they need .
 her role is instantly likeable .
 chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times --
 but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .
 he's definitely a driving force in homer's life ,
 and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic
 that is commendable .
 the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .
 there are moments when
 it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene --
 and there are moments when
 it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .
 it highlights the essence of youth , however ,
 and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .
 october sky should be a success with audiences .
 although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that ,
 it certainly holds an undeniable quality
 that older crowds will lean towards .
 it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre ,
 and one that everyone should see .

a big surprise to me .
 the good trailer had hinted that
 they pulled the impossible off ,
 but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea
 i really had no hope .
 they replaced him just fine .
 not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton ,
 who can really sing .
 the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant ,
 who's ten .
 this was another of my fears for the film ,
 but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica
 ( although he may have been dubbed ) .
 things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .
 i'm quite pleased that
 there were less car pile-ups ,
 because they meant less music ,
 and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .
 there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up ,
 but after that it all stops .
 it's just the music .
 one of my problems with the first is that
 cab calloway's song is so good
 the actually blues brothers look dull after him ,
 but there's no problems with this .
 the music is all as good as ever ,
 tons of great musicians showing up --
 with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing ,
 all the musicians do a great job .
 the only real problems i had was the special effects .
 these were superfluous and a waste of money .
 since the film isn't doing very well ,
 they could mean
 we have no possibility of another sequel ,
 which i want to see .
 the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .

after having heard so many critics describe " return to me " as an old-fashioned hollywood romance ,
 i kept asking myself going into this movie :
 what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ?
 what made " return to me " old-fashioned and old-hollywood ?
 was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . ,
 legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ?
 was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ?
 the charisma of the two leads ?
 even now i can't say that
 i have gotten any closer to the real answer ,
 because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances .
 i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such .
 which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- 
" return to me " was old-fashioned in the sense that
 it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic ,
 the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider .
 it was traditional , magical .
 we knew
 it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists
 that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in .
 it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that
 it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings .
 the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction .
 from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the " return to me " ballad ( by whom ? ) ,
 we can tell
 we're in for something sweet .
 the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy .
 real people don't act that way ;
 real people aren't that nice .
 we know all this ,
 and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence .
 the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale ,
 but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal .
 everything is ordinary -- yet beautiful -- in this film .
 from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes .
 from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors 
that grace paints .
 from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part .
 " return to me " has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors
 who blend in effortlessly as a family :
 the audience has no trouble at all believing that
 this rambunctious family actually does exist .
 we care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ;
 we're concerned that
 the little boy will pick up cursing from his father .
 whatever hunt did ,
 she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors .
 disappointingly , david alan grier's charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written .
 duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona --
 with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder .
 instead we have a normal guy
who when he falls in love shows more delight
 than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of " the x-files .
 " duchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen .
 minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer .
 though an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other
 as the movie progresses .
 while " return to me " functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker ,
 the story is set up so 
the film ends up having nowhere to develop .
 the entire climax of the film hinges on
 when and how grace is going to tell bob that
 she actually was the recipient of his wife's heart .
 we already know that
 there's going to be a happy ending ;
 we feel like 
we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point .
 as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--
yes , i know she's supposed to have his ex-wife's heart and everything--
it seems too effortless .
 the main subject is a love story ,
 and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters
( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) .
 however , in the spirit of " return to me , " it won't do to be too picky about
 how " old " hollywood tells its stories .
 i loved knowing that
 this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt .
 it shows .
 the bottom line : " return to me " is nothing remarkable ,
 and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that
 you hadn't imagined .

wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell
 that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .
 the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .
it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors .
 the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school .
 it is here that
 we meet all of the core characters .
 there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .
 we first see that
 all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .
 throughout the first portion of the film we see 
how far kelly will go to get sam
 until she accuses him of rape .
 shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that
 sam raped her as well .
 this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing 
until sam is convicted .
 during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how
 sam raped her .
 however , it is later revealed by suzie that
 sam never raped either of the girls ,
 it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .
 after sam is cleared ,
 kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash
 in order for him not to sue her .
 it is then revealed that
 sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .
 it is here that 
the film starts to reveal just
 who is being honest with each other and
 who has their own hidden agenda .
 matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .
 sam is the kind of guy that
 every woman would like to sink their claws into ,
 and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .
 he isn't the obvious best of actors ,
 but dillon does give a convincing performance .
 however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film ,
 making it look as though
 his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , 
although he never had many to start out with in the first place .
 neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .
 suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with
 which are obvious from her first scene in the film .
 campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .
 playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .
 kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader
 who thinks 
she can have any man
 she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .
 one of the most interesting things about this film is how
 it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .
 denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .
 in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character ,
 but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .
 kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .
 this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .
 however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .
 still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .
 in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan ,
 daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez ,
 and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .
 hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .
 although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller ,
 the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . 
this is truly a very good film worth seeing 
if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists .

 no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *
 the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them .
 the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .
 james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film .
 and i liked each film separately
 for which it was .
 now alien 3 is out .
 and it is it's own film in the same right that
 alien and aliens were .
 unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that
 you have seen aliens .
 this is very important as
 the story picks up exactly 
were aliens left off .
 the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .
 the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .
 in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry ,
 which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when
 the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .
 this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .
 everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .
 the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .
 fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .
 when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .
 all the prisoners are men
 who have not seen a woman in many years .
 ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .
 as for the new haircut that
 ripley and the prisoner's sport ,
 there is an infestation of lice on the planet .
 being an ex-prison means that
 there is no way off the planet and no weapons .
 so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .
 i will not go into detail ,
 but you can guess
 what happens here .
 the alien is loose and
 no one believes ripley's outstanding story .
 she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .
 yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .
 it is not gratuitous ,
 in fact , we don't even see them kiss ,
 but it is just as well .
 a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .
 there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .
 in fact i would guess to say that
 there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .
 it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !
 i won't say how ,
 but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle ,
 which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .
 sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .
 her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .
 the rest of the cast is also quite good .
 notably , charles dance as the doctor
 with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .
 alien 3 has a very distinct look .
 this is due largely to its director , david fincher .
 mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .
 his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways
 no " alien " film has before .
 for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .
 the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .
 elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score
 which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting 
that the " alien " series been set in .
 this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .
 this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .
 this is a great score .
 the ending to alien 3 is quite good .
 there were times i thought that 
hollywood would come in and screw it up ,
 but it played very nicely .
 i will not ruin the ending for you .
 go see the film .
 i consider it to be a much more involved film than
 any of the other films released so far this season .
 alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .
 and when they make alien 4 ,
 perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .

are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ?
 wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems 
that lie on the shelves .
 everyweek , wafflemovies . com reviews independent film and big studio pictures 
that deserve a second chance on video .
 here is a sample review : welcome to sarajevo
 in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo ,
 welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror
 america and the world ignored for years .
 set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war .
 the picture opens with
 a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .
 as they make their way down the street ,
 a sniper shoots the mother of the bride .
 yet another reminder that
 daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .
 in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter
 who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church .
 joe is cocky , but also good at heart as
 he continues to carry out kind deeds for people
 he doesn't even know .
 his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .
 michael is quickly growing tired of the horror
 that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest .
 henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy
 who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl
 who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on
 citizens waiting in line for bread .
 he decides to take action when
 a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .
 henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .
 he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .
 during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric )
 who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner .
 he promises to get emira out of harm's way
 if he gets the chance .
 after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children ,
 henderson loses hope .
 however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group
 that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .
 unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption ,
 so henderson pledges to take emira to england .
 the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .
 can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?
 the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .
 director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction
 that has occurred .
 they show the destroyed lives ,
 families that have been split up , and the desolation
 that everyone attempts to cope with .
 this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended .
 the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities .
 one of them is an accomplished musician
 who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert
 when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .
 like the rest of those deeply effected by the war ,
 this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .
 winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware 
that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away 
as you sit safely in your living room .
 the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography
 that captures the devastation of this city
 that hosted the 1984 olympics .
 winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .
 this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com selection mad city .
 we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached .
 however , they are human and question the reason behind it all ,
 why no one cares ,
 and how they can get out .
 stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .
 he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .
 dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .
 henderson realizes that
 he cannot save the world ,
 but he can help a few .
 it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after
 he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .
 woody harrelson continues to prove that
 he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation .
 harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .
 harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one .
 this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career .
 america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years 
after the events of the movie take place .
 for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , 
the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson .
 war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .
 battles are fought thousands of miles away among people
 we have no attachment to .
 televised images of the gulf war are all the experience
 most of us have with war .
 this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world ,
 something we don't do enough of in 90's america .

many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .
 while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films
 which i view .
 there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ;
 however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .
 stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .
 he is passionless 
about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music
 which his craft is responsible for producing .
 even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that
 stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .
 in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual 
 and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .
 camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .
 maxime is so much in love with camille that
 he plans to and does leave his wife .
 like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music 
which emerges .
 when stephane and camille meet ,
 there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .
 however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions
 which she now feels for stephane ,
 stephane only admits that
 camille is attracted to him .
 stephane ignores his feelings for camille ,
 which the audience cannot help but to see is present .
 as the movie progresses ,
 the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .
 these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently .
 stephane becomes even more rational and controlled ,
 while camille becomes more tempestuous ,
 until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .
 however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .
 the audience is led to believe that
 stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .
 however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .
 consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .
 in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier .
 however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing .
 during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as
 they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .
 stephane attempts to remain unchanged .
 however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation .
 one of the most obvious is when
 he defeats maxime in squash .
 the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible .
 american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .
 in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane .
 the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters .
 i am not sure why
 berardinelli says , " at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . "
 this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters 
as who they are .
 i find the ending appropriate ;
 unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .
 this portion of the film is where
 the " sense of closure " could have been successfully accomplished .
 unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .
 while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart ,
 ravel has his day in this film .
 the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best
 i have ever seen .
 the directing in this movie is wonderful .
 the actors and actresses are excellent ,
 each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .
 emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .
 and needless to say , i must say that
 emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .
 besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie
 which i have is that
 the movie is almost too cerebral .
 i almost left with the sense 
little happened
 because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations
 which they end as part of .
 the one question which i am left with 
is
 while they have accepted their lot ,
 has their attitude towards love changed ?
 i have several possibilities
 which i believe 
the movie hints at ,
 but i am unsure of 
which the director is espousing .
 in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters
 who almost develop a relationship .
 in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .
 in itself , i do not believe
 un coeur is a complicated movie .
 where it does become complicated is when
 we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life 
where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .
 i do wonder
 how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .
 however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .
 i would welcome any comments about this movie from any
 who have seen it .

the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two 
are the fine components
 that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '
 the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal 
that was only recently caught .
 he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .
 always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .
 this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .
 when he is prepared to execute his plan ,
 he uses
 what he has learned to fake a stroke .
 now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .
 carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse
 that cares for him .
 she's a very bright person with a good heart .
 yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .
 the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .
 her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .
 worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .
 they became a couple because
 they were king and queen of the prom .
 to her , this made sense long ago .
 but now , it's a different story .
 wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .
 wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .
 carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients ,
 but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .
 however , when henry falls under her care ,
 her outlook begins to change .
 the medical reports may state that 
he suffered a massive stroke .
 carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that
 henry may just be faking it after all .
 maybe she can get through to him ,
 and maybe she can learn something about the money 
that he has stashed away .
 the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of
 carol trying to bring henry ? back to life .
 ' and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?
 perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses . 
if that fails ,
 maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .
 when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance ,
 the movie's direction changes ,
 though it remains equally if not more entertaining .
 carol sees that 
henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .
 she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .
 this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .
 henry and carol's bond grows stronger when
 they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .
 henry needs this heist because 
he is unable to retrieve his original stash .
 meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .
 wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .
 however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .
 the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that 
something will horribly go wrong .
 `where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than
 it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .
 newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that
 at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .
 he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor
 that is undeniably attractive .
 fiorentino is also a fun presence .
 you root for her despite her sense of amorality .
 sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake ,
 but we can see that to escape her dead-end world ,
 she needs to do something drastic .
 with two charismatic characters such as these ,
 it's hard to ignore that
 `where the money is' is where the fun is .

robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight ,
 a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .
 paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .
 harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors
 who have fallen from the limelight .
 when jack sends him on a routine delivery job ,
 however , the old instincts kick in .
 soon , harry is wading through a mystery 
where friendships and lives are on the line ,
 and he no longer knows
 who to trust .
 there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon .
 james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends .
 stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest .
 reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' ,
 and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .
 giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi ,
 and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .
 with a cast like that ,
 it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .
 luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony .
 twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .
 it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics ,
 but it has much more than 
a lot of what passes for film these days .
 the major cast members all deliver strong performances ,
 as can be expected of their caliber .
 however , none of them have that little extra oomph
 which would make them memorable .
 the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn .
 stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher .
 there's more to her character than
 the film takes the time to describe .
 it's a minor , but irritating , flaw .
 with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight .
 it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .
 at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff
 that's packed into an awfully small package .
 still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .

warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film .
 or lots of blood &amp; guts , men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .
 in other words , it's a walter hill film !
 with a john milius script !
 i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .
 these films always contain male characters
 i have a very hard time identifying with , probably due to the likelihood that
 any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .
 and we got tough guys galore , here ;
 drug-running banditos by the dozens , all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered , overall ;
 a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ;
 and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers who'd as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .
 in particular , we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger , powers boothe as the drug kingpin , michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army , and rip torn as the local sheriff .
 torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ;
 he smiles before shooting anyone .
 as to women . . . well , i've never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film ,
 and at this rate , i doubt
 i ever will .
 women exist here to look good , comfort the man , and get argued over .
 gosh ! just like the old days . . . 
frankly , this is a pretty good movie ,
 if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .
 the cinematography is excellent ,
 the cast of characters is broad and has texture ,
 the script is quite good ,
 and the film lets you keep up with 
what's happening yourself ,
 without spelling it out to you .
 i appreciate a film
 that makes me have to think to keep up .
 finally , there's lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups .

accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that
 his cup runneth over .
 one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .
 rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence
 that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation
 that must somehow yield the truth .
 in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .
 yet this surfeit of signals is made to serves a rather pale and thinly realized love story
 whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .
 ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim 
whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .
 but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together ,
 we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .
 his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue 
that remains withheld .
 the same can easily be said for every other character in the film ,
 of which there are too many .
 juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as
this film gets to an emotional heart .
 at least we learn early on that
 she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her ,
 and so we understand why
 she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .
 even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , 
however , that it verges on the comical .
 with so many characters enjoying so little screen time ,
 the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .
 yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that
 i couldn't help but feel that
 greatness was in the air .
 hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .
 there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .
 but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .
 in the end , i was left with the impression that
 i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .
 bore is perhaps too strong a word .
 but after drinking in the rich production values ,
 the cup remains only slightly over half-full .

a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates ,
 a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .
 it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie " fingers " coyle ( mitchum ) .
 he got the nickname when
 a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .
 his current dilemma is that
 he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire ,
 something he feels will be a life sentence for him since
 he doesn't think
 he could survive prison at his age .
 he is also concerned that
 his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .
 he could have cut a deal and gotten off ,
 if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , 
but he figured 
he would never live
 if he did that .
 he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .
 the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and 
then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them 
or else his family gets it .
 on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer
 who pushes the alarm .
 coyle's bestfriend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .
 he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents ,
 as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar 
even though he has a prison record ,
 as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .
 with the sentencing date closing in on him ,
 the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .
 he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something
 that goes against his grain .
 thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire ,
 he gives him the place
 where a sale of machine guns is going down ,
 knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot
like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .
 but foley tells him 
after he arrests the gun-dealer ,
 that new hampshire wants more before 
they take away his jail sentence ,
 they want him to be a full-time informer .
 warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .
 the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and
 the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .
 the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .
 coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , " to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . "
 dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style ,
 having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .
 this is a great atmospheric film due to
 the realistic noir mood it sets ,
 of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in ,
 and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of 
what horrible thing will happen next .
 the city streets are ugly ,
 the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , 
whether it is betrayal or murder .
 there is a fatalistic feel about their lives ,
 something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .
 mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose
 it needs ,
 as it overcomes a thin plot .
 it makes you see the characters
 for what they are without any false sympathy for them .
 mitchum is a loser ;
 and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .
 but in the end , he even loses the respect
 he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy ,
 as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .

" footloose " has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .
 and i hate to admit it ;
 i fell for it .
 the movie is about a teenager ( bacon )
 who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that
 dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .
 he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what
 the magic of dance can do .
 as mentioned at the beginning of this review ,
 " footloose " is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .
 there are virtually no surprises ,
 and the writing is second-rate .
 so why did i enjoy it so much ?
 for one thing , the cast is great .
 kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .
 we're rooting for him right from the start , and ,
 unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the " rebel without a clue " sort .
 yes , he does rebel ,
 but he's also polite 
when he needs to be .
 and he never broods .
 the rest of the cast is equally impressive .
 john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man
 who would normally be a flat out villian .
 but lithgow plays him as a concerned father
 who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .
 by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .
 another nice touch is the music .
 we see the parents of the kids complaining that
 the music they listen to is filled with " sexual innuendos " ,
 but that's not true at all .
 the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .
 during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .
 of course , i soon realized 
that would be a little pathetic .
 anyway , " footloose " is a charming little surprise .
 don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .
 it sucked me in ,
 and it'll do the same to you .

as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon
 i thought to myself that
 i had had just seen a great film .
 with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of 
whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a " great " piece of work and viceversa .
 attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .
 i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .
 as the word implies ,
 a masterpiece is any work
 which embodies the skills of a master .
 as such it should suffice to say that
 it is a product of exceptional quality .
 crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .
 crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology .
 it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters
 which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul
 that makes them ultimately vulnerable .
 all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .
 the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil ,
 which must choose between the two .
 it is the gifted pupil
 who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword
 which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .
 the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .
 the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .
 the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art ,
 as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and
 the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .
 there need be no question of suspended disbelief when
 one is in the presence of poetry .
 as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line ,
 which takes place at an ordinary human level ,
 yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .
 do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed .
 for those who are put off by the " art " label 
this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance .
 there are no weak performances in this movie .
 michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom .
 chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart .
 zhang ziyi is a budding superstar .
 she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role .
 cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably .
 kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun ,
 each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film .
 ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit .
 this is destined to be one of those films 
that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies .
 don't miss it .

" crazy/beautiful " suffers from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don't syndrome .
 after a spate of flighty , cookie-cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story .
 but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown " afterschool special . "
 even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people ,
 the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to " tone things down . "
 needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . "
 we were trying to make a cautionary tale , " he told newsweek , " and we couldn't show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . "
 regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and
 a script determined to transcend stereotypes .
 " crazy/beautiful " is quality fare , good enough that
 i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for " failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . "
 set in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens .
 every morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school .
 an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused 
as he works on securing a place in the naval academy .
 all is well until
 he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) .
 nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction .
 carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her ,
 but he is only human and
 she has the greatest smile .
 plus , as her father notes ,
 she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral .
 as with " save the last dance , " " crazy/beautiful " ( god , how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh .
 while noting the racial and social differences between the kids ,
 the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s (
 there are still several mtv moments , though ) .
 the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading
 that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes
 and the actors take it from there .
 cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole's behavior .
 she is credible enough that
 when dad urges carlos to get away from her 
before she drags him down ,
 i hoped 
the boy would listen . 
as carlos , hernandez is a revelation .
 hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ;
 we will see a lot of this guy in the future .
 aside from its title , the biggest problem with " crazy/beautiful " is its ending ,
 which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy .
 after carefully presenting credible characters and situations ,
 the conclusion feels rushed and lazy .
 still , this is the kind of film 
that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots .
 " afterschool special " my ass ?
 " crazy/beautiful " is the real deal .

everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything
 that could in any way be associated with " progress . "
 giles is a writer ,
 but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff
 that is immediately put onto library stacks
 where it can gather dust until 
some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .
 his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets ,
 only the electric lights betray that
 he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .
 this is the kind of role 
that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but
 john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns " erstwhile fogy " giles into a three-dimensional human being .
 despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man ,
 especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction 
to which no one is immune : love .
 and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture ,
 it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .
 giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema ,
 but when he learns that 
an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater ,
 he screws up his courage and decides to go .
 what he doesn't realize is that
 the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .
 a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .
 just as giles is about to leave , however ,
 he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) ,
 and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .
 giles is enraptured ,
 and the moment hotpants college ii is over ,
 he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .
 ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr ,
 but he initially doesn't realize that
 he needs a tv to use the vcr . )
 eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island ,
 where his idol's home is located .
 bostock is away 
when giles arrives ,
 but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .
 eventually , the actor arrives home and ,
 impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .
 but , while giles' affection runs deep ,
 ronnie's feelings are less constant .
 love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .
 in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .
 it suffers a fall-off
 once giles reaches new york ,
 and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material
 that precedes it .
 in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .
 in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love ,
 even if it is unrequited .
 from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ?
 he's in almost every frame .
 it's a role 
that the veteran actor must have relished ,
 because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .
 jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .
 he is charismatic ,
 and it's not hard to understand why
 giles is attracted to ronnie .
 meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .
 love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a " fish out of water " tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .
 yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers ,
 it never takes cheap shots .
 it has a vibrant , beating heart ?
 and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .

for many people , procrastination isn't a problem to overcome ,
 it's a high art .
 we'll do just about anything to put off a task .
 when the deadline for this column nears ,
 it's the only time during the week
 dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and . . . 
eventually , hopefully , sometimes , there's a breakthrough and
 we actually get down to work .
 amazingly it's almost always easier
 than we dreaded and
 after finishing , that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away .
 and then , the next time , we do it all again .
 english professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master .
 seven years ago , his first book was a hit .
 he's been working on his second -- a short 200-page piece -- since then .
 fearful that he can't live up to the first ,
 he can't bring himself to finish it .
 no writer's block , he's nearing 3 , 000 pages with no end in sight .
 now he's having a particularly difficult day .
 the college's annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that
 other people are finishing _their_ books .
 during the first day , his wife has left him ,
 his married girlfriend informs him 
she's pregnant and
 his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow .
 by the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk .
 this could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis .
 and then there's the next morning .
 there's a lot to like about this movie .
 there are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues .
 grady is caught up in the curse of people
 who accomplish great things early in their career .
 in the world of " what have you done for me lately ? " , he knows
 his second book has to be better than his first .
 instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood .
 he doesn't have much of a life and 
neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) .
 james may be suicidal and psychotic .
 certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie .
 he makes up a past of working clash anguish because
 the truth of wealth and comfort just isn't interesting enough .
 as the weekend progresses ,
 they are both forced to fully engage life .
 that's the question 
they must face : comfort or real experiences ?
 the film takes some interesting chances .
 non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact .
 extra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren't judged , merely choices .
 the actors are all first-rate .
 douglas triumphs , playing against type as
 he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women's house robe .
 maguire's disengaged alienation works perfectly here .
 robert downey jr . as grady's agent livens up his scenes .
 director curtis hanson ( " l . a . confidential " ) makes a few missteps .
 the women are underused .
 frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady's married lover 
but we never understand much of
 who she is .
 the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent
 which makes some of the ending unconvincing .
 katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor ,
 but her character goes nowhere .
 we never even see grady's exiting wife .
 this is very much a guy's film .
 the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .
 grady's alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara .
 as the boomers age , 
expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic .
 eventually it'll probably become cliche ,
 but right now we've got a winner .
 i'll finish this in a second .
 right now i have to grab some paint .
 i noticed some trim in the other room
 that needs a little touch-up .
 ( michael redman has written this column for so long that
 he's made mid-life crisis a career choice . )

meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) starring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani
 in " meet joe black " , brad pitt plays death .
 that's all
 that really needs to be said ,
 but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you
 that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description .
 death decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what
 it's like to be human .
 death assumes the body of brad pitt , and
 from there , much trouble ensues .
 for one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani .
 obviously this enrages hopkins , because really ,
 what can death offer ?
 besides eternal damnation , of course .
 there is also a sub-plot about
 forlani's ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company .
 " meet joe black " runs just under three hours .
 i've always thought that
 such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics .
 " meet joe black " is neither historical 
nor is it an epic ,
 though i get the feeling
 martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be .
 every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long .
 and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than
 it really should .
 a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good ,
 which is what it is .
 pitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death .
 i believed his performance ,
 and i could see why
 forlani's character would fall in love with him .
 i have to agree with roger ebert , though ,
 who found it hard to believe that
 an entity that's been around for all time wouldn't know what peanut butter was .
 that has nothing to do with pitt's performance , of course ,
 but it is a little distracting .
 hopkins gives his usual excellent performance .
 he's able to portray the angst of a man
who knows 
he has very little time left ,
 without making him an obnoxious whiner .
 and in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good .
 she has a sweet tenderness 
that allows the audience to instantly root for her .
 so , " meet joe black " is a good movie hampered by it's ridiculous running time .
 had the film been cut by an hour or so ,
 i have no doubt that
 i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review .

call it touched by a demon .
 gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist .
 if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both
 those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and 
those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven .
 in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here ,
 albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .
 ( remember bob ? )
 the biggest failing of fallen is that ,
 although it's consistently interesting ,
 it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as
 one might hope .
 a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia ,
 but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice .
 now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , " what goes around really goes around . "
 shortly thereafter , he begins to sing " time is on my side " as
 he's taken on his last walk .
 minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution
 and edgar reese is dead .
 but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning ,
 because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ?
 he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .
 and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will .
 only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what
 they're up against .
 the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result ,
 they are in mortal danger .
 as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .
 no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . 
the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ;
 it's geno's steaks .
 shadows and night scenes abound .
 the days are cloudy and unpromising .
 this is the kind of setting where
 it's easy to believe that
 fallen angels walk among men .
 fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized .
 somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge
 from something with this kind of premise .
 but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check .
 nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as
 the spirit of azazel moves from body to body 
when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .
 the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind
 that can best be described as unusual .
 of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) ,
 who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance .
 john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself ,
 although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .
 sadly , however , these two are the only ones
 who excel .
 everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring .
 washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .
 it's not that
 he's bad per se ,
 but he's not very interesting .
 there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way 
he portrays his character ,
 and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes .
 as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop ,
 and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate ,
 i expected to be more on the edge of my seat
 than i was .
 washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ;
 i never felt a sense of urgency .
 however , at least washington was believable ,
 which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland .
 to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ;
 neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .
 that said , however ,
 there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work .
 both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts ,
 as if they know that
 their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .
 narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .
 although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure ,
 it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .
 at times , this is actually helpful ,
 and it has a use beyond the obvious ,
 but there are occasions when
 ponderous lines like " i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself " become a little hard to swallow .
 in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .
 however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending ,
 which i loved .
 the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected .
 it's not often that
 a plot development takes me by surprise the way
 this one did .
 at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes ,
 fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .
 this is not a great motion picture ,
 but , considering how bad most january releases are ,
 it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .
 and , whatever you do ,
 don't walk out on the film before
 the end credits have begun to roll .
